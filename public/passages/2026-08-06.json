  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>After this I heard what sounded like the roar of a great multitude in heaven shouting: “Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God, <sup>2</sup>for true and just are his judgments. He has condemned the great prostitute who corrupted the earth by her adulteries. He has avenged on her the blood of his servants.” <sup>3</sup>And again they shouted: “Hallelujah! The smoke from her goes up for ever and ever.” <sup>4</sup>The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God, who was seated on the throne. And they cried: “Amen, Hallelujah!” <sup>5</sup>Then a voice came from the throne, saying: “Praise our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, both great and small!” <sup>6</sup>Then I heard what sounded like a great multitude, like the roar of rushing waters and like loud peals of thunder, shouting: “Hallelujah! For our Lord God Almighty reigns. <sup>7</sup>Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory! For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself ready. <sup>8</sup>Fine linen, bright and clean, was given her to wear.” (Fine linen stands for the righteous acts of God’s holy people.)",
