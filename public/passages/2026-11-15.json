  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Keep me safe, my God, for in you I take refuge. <sup>2</sup>I say to the Lord, “You are my Lord; apart from you I have no good thing.” <sup>3</sup>I say of the holy people who are in the land, “They are the noble ones in whom is all my delight.” <sup>4</sup>Those who run after other gods will suffer more and more. I will not pour out libations of blood to such gods or take up their names on my lips. <sup>5</sup>Lord, you alone are my portion and my cup; you make my lot secure. <sup>6</sup>The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; surely I have a delightful inheritance. <sup>7</sup>I will praise the Lord, who counsels me; even at night my heart instructs me. <sup>8</sup>I keep my eyes always on the Lord. With him at my right hand, I will not be shaken. <sup>9</sup>Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will rest secure, <sup>10</sup>because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead, nor will you let your faithful one see decay. <sup>11</sup>You make known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.",
