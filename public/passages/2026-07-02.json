  "verses": "<sup>57</sup>As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, “I will follow you wherever you go.” <sup>58</sup>Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.” <sup>59</sup>He said to another man, “Follow me.” But he replied, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.” <sup>60</sup>Jesus said to him, “Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.” <sup>61</sup>Still another said, “I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say goodbye to my family.” <sup>62</sup>Jesus replied, “No one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.”",
