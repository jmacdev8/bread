  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>“Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will bring justice to the nations. <sup>2</sup>He will not shout or cry out, or raise his voice in the streets. <sup>3</sup>A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out. In faithfulness he will bring forth justice; <sup>4</sup>he will not falter or be discouraged till he establishes justice on earth. In his teaching the islands will put their hope.” <sup>5</sup>This is what God the Lord says— the Creator of the heavens, who stretches them out, who spreads out the earth with all that springs from it, who gives breath to its people, and life to those who walk on it: <sup>6</sup>“I, the Lord, have called you in righteousness; I will take hold of your hand. I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people and a light for the Gentiles, <sup>7</sup>to open eyes that are blind, to free captives from prison and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness. <sup>8</sup>“I am the Lord; that is my name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols. <sup>9</sup>See, the former things have taken place, and new things I declare; before they spring into being I announce them to you.”",
