  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, in keeping with the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus, <sup>2</sup>To Timothy, my dear son: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. <sup>3</sup>I thank God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers. <sup>4</sup>Recalling your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy. <sup>5</sup>I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also. <sup>6</sup>For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands. <sup>7</sup>For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline. <sup>8</sup>So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me his prisoner. Rather, join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God. <sup>9</sup>He has saved us and called us to a holy life—not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time, <sup>10</sup>but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. <sup>11</sup>And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher. <sup>12</sup>That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet this is no cause for shame, because I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day. <sup>13</sup>What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus. <sup>14</sup>Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you—guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.",
