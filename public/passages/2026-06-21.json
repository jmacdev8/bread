  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory in the heavens. <sup>2</sup>Through the praise of children and infants you have established a stronghold against your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger. <sup>3</sup>When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, <sup>4</sup>what is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for them? <sup>5</sup>You have made them a little lower than the angels and crowned them with glory and honor. <sup>6</sup>You made them rulers over the works of your hands; you put everything under their feet: <sup>7</sup>all flocks and herds, and the animals of the wild, <sup>8</sup>the birds in the sky, and the fish in the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas. <sup>9</sup>Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!",
