  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain. Unless the Lord watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain. <sup>2</sup>In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat— for he grants sleep to those he loves. <sup>3</sup>Children are a heritage from the Lord, offspring a reward from him. <sup>4</sup>Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are children born in one’s youth. <sup>5</sup>Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. They will not be put to shame when they contend with their opponents in court.",
