Then why do I see every strong man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor, every face turned deathly pale? <sup>7</sup>How awful that day will be! No other will be like it. It will be a time of trouble for Jacob, but he will be saved out of it. <sup>8</sup>“ ‘In that day,’ declares the Lord Almighty, ‘I will break the yoke off their necks and will tear off their bonds; no longer will foreigners enslave them. <sup>9</sup>Instead, they will serve the Lord their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them. <sup>10</sup>“ ‘So do not be afraid, Jacob my servant; do not be dismayed, Israel,’ declares the Lord. ‘I will surely save you out of a distant place, your descendants from the land of their exile. Jacob will again have peace and security, and no one will make him afraid.",
