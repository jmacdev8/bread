  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>My heart is not proud, Lord, my eyes are not haughty; I do not concern myself with great matters or things too wonderful for me. <sup>2</sup>But I have calmed and quieted myself, I am like a weaned child with its mother; like a weaned child I am content. <sup>3</sup>Israel, put your hope in the Lord both now and forevermore.",
