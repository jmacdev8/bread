  "verses": "<p><sup>1</sup>Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. <sup>2</sup>(This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.) <sup>3</sup>So the sisters sent word to Jesus, “Lord, the one you love is sick.”</p><p><sup>4</sup>When he heard this, Jesus said, “This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for God’s glory so that God’s Son may be glorified through it.” <sup>5</sup>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. <sup>6</sup>So when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days, <sup>7</sup>and then he said to his disciples, “Let us go back to Judea.”</p><p><sup>8</sup>“But Rabbi,” they said, “a short while ago the Jews there tried to stone you, and yet you are going back?”</p><p><sup>9</sup>Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours of daylight? Anyone who walks in the daytime will not stumble, for they see by this world’s light. <sup>10</sup>It is when a person walks at night that they stumble, for they have no light.”</p><p><sup>11</sup>After he had said this, he went on to tell them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him up.”</p><p><sup>12</sup>His disciples replied, “Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better.” <sup>13</sup>Jesus had been speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep.</p><p><sup>14</sup>So then he told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead, <sup>15</sup>and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.”</p><p><sup>16</sup>Then Thomas (also known as Didymus) said to the rest of the disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with him.”</p>",
