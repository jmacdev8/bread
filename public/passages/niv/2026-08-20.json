  "verses": "<p><sup>18</sup>While he was saying this, a synagogue leader came and knelt before him and said, “My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live.” <sup>19</sup>Jesus got up and went with him, and so did his disciples.</p><p><sup>20</sup>Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak. <sup>21</sup>She said to herself, “If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed.”</p><p><sup>22</sup>Jesus turned and saw her. “Take heart, daughter,” he said, “your faith has healed you.” And the woman was healed at that moment.</p><p><sup>23</sup>When Jesus entered the synagogue leader’s house and saw the noisy crowd and people playing pipes, <sup>24</sup>he said, “Go away. The girl is not dead but asleep.” But they laughed at him. <sup>25</sup>After the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up. <sup>26</sup>News of this spread through all that region.</p>",
