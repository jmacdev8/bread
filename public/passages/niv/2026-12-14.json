  "verses": "<p><sup>1</sup>As Jesus was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Look, Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!”</p><p><sup>2</sup>“Do you see all these great buildings?” replied Jesus. “Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.”</p><p><sup>3</sup>As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John and Andrew asked him privately, <sup>4</sup>“Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled?”</p><p><sup>5</sup>Jesus said to them: “Watch out that no one deceives you. <sup>6</sup>Many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am he,’ and will deceive many. <sup>7</sup>When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. <sup>8</sup>Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines. These are the beginning of birth pains.</p><p><sup>9</sup>“You must be on your guard. You will be handed over to the local councils and flogged in the synagogues. On account of me you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to them. <sup>10</sup>And the gospel must first be preached to all nations. <sup>11</sup>Whenever you are arrested and brought to trial, do not worry beforehand about what to say. Just say whatever is given you at the time, for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.</p><p><sup>12</sup>“Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. <sup>13</sup>Everyone will hate you because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.</p>",
