  "verses": "<p><sup>9</sup>As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him.</p><p><sup>10</sup>While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples. <sup>11</sup>When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”</p><p><sup>12</sup>On hearing this, Jesus said, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. <sup>13</sup>But go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”</p>",
