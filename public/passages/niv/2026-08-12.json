  "verses": "<p><sup>1</sup>Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ,</p><p>To those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have received a faith as precious as ours:</p><p><sup>2</sup>Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.</p><p><sup>3</sup>His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness. <sup>4</sup>Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature, having escaped the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.</p><p><sup>5</sup>For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; <sup>6</sup>and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; <sup>7</sup>and to godliness, mutual affection; and to mutual affection, love. <sup>8</sup>For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup>9</sup>But whoever does not have them is nearsighted and blind, forgetting that they have been cleansed from their past sins.</p><p><sup>10</sup>Therefore, my brothers and sisters, make every effort to confirm your calling and election. For if you do these things, you will never stumble, <sup>11</sup>and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>",
