  "verses": "<p><sup>15</sup>Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.</p><p><sup>16</sup>When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, <sup>17</sup>where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them. <sup>18</sup>A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough. <sup>19</sup>When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water; and they were frightened. <sup>20</sup>But he said to them, “It is I; don’t be afraid.” <sup>21</sup>Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading.</p>",
