  "verses": "<p><sup>60</sup>On hearing it, many of his disciples said, “This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?”</p><p><sup>61</sup>Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, “Does this offend you? <sup>62</sup>Then what if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before! <sup>63</sup>The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life. <sup>64</sup>Yet there are some of you who do not believe.” For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him. <sup>65</sup>He went on to say, “This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled them.”</p><p><sup>66</sup>From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him.</p><p><sup>67</sup>“You do not want to leave too, do you?” Jesus asked the Twelve.</p><p><sup>68</sup>Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. <sup>69</sup>We have come to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God.”</p><p><sup>70</sup>Then Jesus replied, “Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!” <sup>71</sup>(He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray him.)</p>",
