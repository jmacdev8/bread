  "verses": "<p><sup>16</sup>“I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves. <sup>17</sup>Be on your guard; you will be handed over to the local councils and be flogged in the synagogues. <sup>18</sup>On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles. <sup>19</sup>But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say, <sup>20</sup>for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.</p><p><sup>21</sup>“Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. <sup>22</sup>You will be hated by everyone because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. <sup>23</sup>When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.</p>",
