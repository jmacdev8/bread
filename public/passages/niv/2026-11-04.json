  "verses": "<p><sup>21</sup>To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps.</p><p><sup>22</sup>“He committed no sin,</p><p>and no deceit was found in his mouth.”</p><p><sup>23</sup>When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly. <sup>24</sup>“He himself bore our sins” in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; “by his wounds you have been healed.” <sup>25</sup>For “you were like sheep going astray,” but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</p>",
