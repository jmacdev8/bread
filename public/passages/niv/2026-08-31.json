  "verses": "<p><sup>1</sup>Therefore if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, <sup>2</sup>then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind. <sup>3</sup>Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, <sup>4</sup>not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.</p><p><sup>5</sup>In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus:</p><p><sup>6</sup>Who, being in very nature God,</p><p>did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage;</p><p><sup>7</sup>rather, he made himself nothing</p><p>by taking the very nature of a servant,</p><p>being made in human likeness.</p><p><sup>8</sup>And being found in appearance as a man,</p><p>he humbled himself</p><p>by becoming obedient to death—</p><p>even death on a cross!</p>",
