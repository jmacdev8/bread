  "verses": "<p></p><p><sup>18</sup>When the people saw the thunder and lightning and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain in smoke, they trembled with fear. They stayed at a distance <sup>19</sup>and said to Moses, “Speak to us yourself and we will listen. But do not have God speak to us or we will die.”</p><p><sup>20</sup>Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid. God has come to test you, so that the fear of God will be with you to keep you from sinning.”</p><p><sup>21</sup>The people remained at a distance, while Moses approached the thick darkness where God was.</p><p><sup>22</sup>Then the Lord said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites this: ‘You have seen for yourselves that I have spoken to you from heaven: <sup>23</sup>Do not make any gods to be alongside me; do not make for yourselves gods of silver or gods of gold.</p><p><sup>24</sup>“ ‘Make an altar of earth for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, your sheep and goats and your cattle. Wherever I cause my name to be honored, I will come to you and bless you. <sup>25</sup>If you make an altar of stones for me, do not build it with dressed stones, for you will defile it if you use a tool on it. <sup>26</sup>And do not go up to my altar on steps, or your private parts may be exposed.’</p>",
