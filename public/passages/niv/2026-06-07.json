  "verses": "<p><sup>1</sup>I waited patiently for the Lord;</p><p>he turned to me and heard my cry.</p><p><sup>2</sup>He lifted me out of the slimy pit,</p><p>out of the mud and mire;</p><p>he set my feet on a rock</p><p>and gave me a firm place to stand.</p><p><sup>3</sup>He put a new song in my mouth,</p><p>a hymn of praise to our God.</p><p>Many will see and fear the Lord</p><p>and put their trust in him.</p><p></p><p><sup>4</sup>Blessed is the one</p><p>who trusts in the Lord,</p><p>who does not look to the proud,</p><p>to those who turn aside to false gods.</p><p><sup>5</sup>Many, Lord my God,</p><p>are the wonders you have done,</p><p>the things you planned for us.</p><p>None can compare with you;</p><p>were I to speak and tell of your deeds,</p><p>they would be too many to declare.</p><p></p><p><sup>6</sup>Sacrifice and offering you did not desire—</p><p>but my ears you have opened—</p><p>burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not require.</p><p><sup>7</sup>Then I said, “Here I am, I have come—</p><p>it is written about me in the scroll.</p><p><sup>8</sup>I desire to do your will, my God;</p><p>your law is within my heart.”</p><p></p><p><sup>9</sup>I proclaim your saving acts in the great assembly;</p><p>I do not seal my lips, Lord,</p><p>as you know.</p><p><sup>10</sup>I do not hide your righteousness in my heart;</p><p>I speak of your faithfulness and your saving help.</p><p>I do not conceal your love and your faithfulness</p><p>from the great assembly.</p><p></p><p><sup>11</sup>Do not withhold your mercy from me, Lord;</p><p>may your love and faithfulness always protect me.</p><p><sup>12</sup>For troubles without number surround me;</p><p>my sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see.</p><p>They are more than the hairs of my head,</p><p>and my heart fails within me.</p><p><sup>13</sup>Be pleased to save me, Lord;</p><p>come quickly, Lord, to help me.</p><p></p><p><sup>14</sup>May all who want to take my life</p><p>be put to shame and confusion;</p><p>may all who desire my ruin</p><p>be turned back in disgrace.</p><p><sup>15</sup>May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!”</p><p>be appalled at their own shame.</p><p><sup>16</sup>But may all who seek you</p><p>rejoice and be glad in you;</p><p>may those who long for your saving help always say,</p><p>“The Lord is great!”</p><p></p><p><sup>17</sup>But as for me, I am poor and needy;</p><p>may the Lord think of me.</p><p>You are my help and my deliverer;</p><p>you are my God, do not delay.</p>",
