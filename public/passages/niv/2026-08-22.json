  "verses": "<p><sup>46</sup>Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (which means “son of Timaeus”), was sitting by the roadside begging. <sup>47</sup>When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”</p><p><sup>48</sup>Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”</p><p><sup>49</sup>Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.”</p><p>So they called to the blind man, “Cheer up! On your feet! He’s calling you.” <sup>50</sup>Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus.</p><p><sup>51</sup>“What do you want me to do for you?” Jesus asked him.</p><p>The blind man said, “Rabbi, I want to see.”</p><p><sup>52</sup>“Go,” said Jesus, “your faith has healed you.” Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.</p>",
