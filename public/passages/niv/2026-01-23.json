  "verses": "<p><sup>22</sup>Then came the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter, <sup>23</sup>and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon’s Colonnade. <sup>24</sup>The Jews who were there gathered around him, saying, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.”</p><p><sup>25</sup>Jesus answered, “I did tell you, but you do not believe. The works I do in my Father’s name testify about me, <sup>26</sup>but you do not believe because you are not my sheep. <sup>27</sup>My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. <sup>28</sup>I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. <sup>29</sup>My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. <sup>30</sup>I and the Father are one.”</p>",
