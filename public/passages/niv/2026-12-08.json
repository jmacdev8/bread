He is to be called John.”</p><p><sup>61</sup>They said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who has that name.”</p><p><sup>62</sup>Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child. <sup>63</sup>He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone’s astonishment he wrote, “His name is John.” <sup>64</sup>Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue set free, and he began to speak, praising God. <sup>65</sup>All the neighbors were filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things. <sup>66</sup>Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, “What then is this child going to be?” For the Lord’s hand was with him.</p><p><sup>67</sup>His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:</p><p><sup>68</sup>“Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,</p><p>because he has come to his people and redeemed them.</p><p><sup>69</sup>He has raised up a horn of salvation for us</p><p>in the house of his servant David</p><p><sup>70</sup>(as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),</p><p><sup>71</sup>salvation from our enemies</p><p>and from the hand of all who hate us—</p><p><sup>72</sup>to show mercy to our ancestors</p><p>and to remember his holy covenant,</p><p><sup>73</sup>the oath he swore to our father Abraham:</p><p><sup>74</sup>to rescue us from the hand of our enemies,</p><p>and to enable us to serve him without fear</p><p><sup>75</sup>in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.</p><p></p><p></p><p><sup>76</sup>And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High;</p><p>for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,</p><p><sup>77</sup>to give his people the knowledge of salvation</p><p>through the forgiveness of their sins,</p><p><sup>78</sup>because of the tender mercy of our God,</p><p>by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven</p><p><sup>79</sup>to shine on those living in darkness</p><p>and in the shadow of death,</p><p>to guide our feet into the path of peace.”</p><p><sup>80</sup>And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the wilderness until he appeared publicly to Israel.</p>",
