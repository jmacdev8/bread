  "verses": "<p><sup>15</sup>When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?”</p><p>“Yes, Lord,” he said, “you know that I love you.”</p><p>Jesus said, “Feed my lambs.”</p><p><sup>16</sup>Again Jesus said, “Simon son of John, do you love me?”</p><p>He answered, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”</p><p>Jesus said, “Take care of my sheep.”</p><p><sup>17</sup>The third time he said to him, “Simon son of John, do you love me?”</p><p>Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, “Do you love me?” He said, “Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.”</p><p>Jesus said, “Feed my sheep. <sup>18</sup>Very truly I tell you, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.” <sup>19</sup>Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, “Follow me!”</p><p><sup>20</sup>Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, “Lord, who is going to betray you?”) <sup>21</sup>When Peter saw him, he asked, “Lord, what about him?”</p><p><sup>22</sup>Jesus answered, “If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me.” <sup>23</sup>Because of this, the rumor spread among the believers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, “If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?”</p>",
