  "verses": "<p><sup>41</sup>Peter asked, “Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everyone?”</p><p><sup>42</sup>The Lord answered, “Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time? <sup>43</sup>It will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns. <sup>44</sup>Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. <sup>45</sup>But suppose the servant says to himself, ‘My master is taking a long time in coming,’ and he then begins to beat the other servants, both men and women, and to eat and drink and get drunk. <sup>46</sup>The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers.</p><p><sup>47</sup>“The servant who knows the master’s will and does not get ready or does not do what the master wants will be beaten with many blows. <sup>48</sup>But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.</p>",
