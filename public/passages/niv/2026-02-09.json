  "verses": "<p><sup>7</sup>When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable: <sup>8</sup>“When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited. <sup>9</sup>If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, ‘Give this person your seat.’ Then, humiliated, you will have to take the least important place. <sup>10</sup>But when you are invited, take the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he will say to you, ‘Friend, move up to a better place.’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all the other guests. <sup>11</sup>For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”</p><p><sup>12</sup>Then Jesus said to his host, “When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or sisters, your relatives, or your rich neighbors; if you do, they may invite you back and so you will be repaid. <sup>13</sup>But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, <sup>14</sup>and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”</p>",
