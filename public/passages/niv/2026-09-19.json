  "verses": "<p><sup>1</sup>but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</p><p><sup>2</sup>At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them. <sup>3</sup>The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group <sup>4</sup>and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. <sup>5</sup>In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?” <sup>6</sup>They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him.</p><p>But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. <sup>7</sup>When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.” <sup>8</sup>Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.</p><p><sup>9</sup>At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. <sup>10</sup>Jesus straightened up and asked her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?”</p><p><sup>11</sup>“No one, sir,” she said.</p><p>“Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared. “Go now and leave your life of sin.”</p><p>————————————————————</p>",
