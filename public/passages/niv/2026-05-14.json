  "verses": "<p><sup>7</sup>Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard. <sup>8</sup>Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and in you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining.</p><p><sup>9</sup>Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister is still in the darkness. <sup>10</sup>Anyone who loves their brother and sister lives in the light, and there is nothing in them to make them stumble. <sup>11</sup>But anyone who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness. They do not know where they are going, because the darkness has blinded them.</p><p><sup>12</sup>I am writing to you, dear children,</p><p>because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name.</p><p><sup>13</sup>I am writing to you, fathers,</p><p>because you know him who is from the beginning.</p><p>I am writing to you, young men,</p><p>because you have overcome the evil one.</p><p></p><p><sup>14</sup>I write to you, dear children,</p><p>because you know the Father.</p><p>I write to you, fathers,</p><p>because you know him who is from the beginning.</p><p>I write to you, young men,</p><p>because you are strong,</p><p>and the word of God lives in you,</p><p>and you have overcome the evil one.</p><p><sup>15</sup>Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them. <sup>16</sup>For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world. <sup>17</sup>The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever.</p>",
