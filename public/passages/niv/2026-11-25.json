Can anything good come from there?” Nathanael asked.</p><p>“Come and see,” said Philip.</p><p><sup>47</sup>When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, “Here truly is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit.”</p><p><sup>48</sup>“How do you know me?” Nathanael asked.</p><p>Jesus answered, “I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.”</p><p><sup>49</sup>Then Nathanael declared, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the king of Israel.”</p><p><sup>50</sup>Jesus said, “You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You will see greater things than that.” <sup>51</sup>He then added, “Very truly I tell you, you will see ‘heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on’ the Son of Man.”</p>",
