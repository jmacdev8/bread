  "verses": "<p><sup>1</sup>Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up. <sup>2</sup>He said: “In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought. <sup>3</sup>And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, ‘Grant me justice against my adversary.’</p><p><sup>4</sup>“For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, ‘Even though I don’t fear God or care what people think, <sup>5</sup>yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won’t eventually come and attack me!’ ”</p><p><sup>6</sup>And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unjust judge says. <sup>7</sup>And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? <sup>8</sup>I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?”</p>",
