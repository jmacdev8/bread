  "verses": "<p><sup>8</sup>Finally, all of you, be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble. <sup>9</sup>Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary, repay evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing. <sup>10</sup>For,</p><p>“Whoever would love life</p><p>and see good days</p><p>must keep their tongue from evil</p><p>and their lips from deceitful speech.</p><p><sup>11</sup>They must turn from evil and do good;</p><p>they must seek peace and pursue it.</p><p><sup>12</sup>For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous</p><p>and his ears are attentive to their prayer,</p><p>but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”</p>",
