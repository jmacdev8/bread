  "verses": "<p><sup>1</sup>And he said to them, “Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see that the kingdom of God has come with power.”</p><p><sup>2</sup>After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John with him and led them up a high mountain, where they were all alone. There he was transfigured before them. <sup>3</sup>His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them. <sup>4</sup>And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses, who were talking with Jesus.</p><p><sup>5</sup>Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.” <sup>6</sup>(He did not know what to say, they were so frightened.)</p><p><sup>7</sup>Then a cloud appeared and covered them, and a voice came from the cloud: “This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!”</p><p><sup>8</sup>Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus.</p>",
