  "verses": "<p><sup>21</sup>Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, “Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?”</p><p><sup>22</sup>Jesus answered, “I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.</p><p><sup>23</sup>“Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. <sup>24</sup>As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold was brought to him. <sup>25</sup>Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.</p><p><sup>26</sup>“At this the servant fell on his knees before him. ‘Be patient with me,’ he begged, ‘and I will pay back everything.’ <sup>27</sup>The servant’s master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go.</p><p><sup>28</sup>“But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins. He grabbed him and began to choke him. ‘Pay back what you owe me!’ he demanded.</p><p><sup>29</sup>“His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay it back.’</p><p><sup>30</sup>“But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt. <sup>31</sup>When the other servants saw what had happened, they were outraged and went and told their master everything that had happened.</p><p><sup>32</sup>“Then the master called the servant in. ‘You wicked servant,’ he said, ‘I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to. <sup>33</sup>Shouldn’t you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?’ <sup>34</sup>In anger his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed.</p><p><sup>35</sup>“This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.”</p>",
