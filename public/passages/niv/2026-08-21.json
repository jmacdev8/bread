  "verses": "<p><sup>27</sup>As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”</p><p><sup>28</sup>When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?”</p><p>“Yes, Lord,” they replied.</p><p><sup>29</sup>Then he touched their eyes and said, “According to your faith let it be done to you”; <sup>30</sup>and their sight was restored. Jesus warned them sternly, “See that no one knows about this.” <sup>31</sup>But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region.</p><p><sup>32</sup>While they were going out, a man who was demon-possessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus. <sup>33</sup>And when the demon was driven out, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.”</p><p><sup>34</sup>But the Pharisees said, “It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons.”</p>",
