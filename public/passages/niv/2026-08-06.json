  "verses": "<p><sup>1</sup>After this I heard what sounded like the roar of a great multitude in heaven shouting:</p><p>“Hallelujah!</p><p>Salvation and glory and power belong to our God,</p><p><sup>2</sup>for true and just are his judgments.</p><p>He has condemned the great prostitute</p><p>who corrupted the earth by her adulteries.</p><p>He has avenged on her the blood of his servants.”</p><p><sup>3</sup>And again they shouted:</p><p>“Hallelujah!</p><p>The smoke from her goes up for ever and ever.”</p><p><sup>4</sup>The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God, who was seated on the throne. And they cried:</p><p>“Amen, Hallelujah!”</p><p><sup>5</sup>Then a voice came from the throne, saying:</p><p>“Praise our God,</p><p>all you his servants,</p><p>you who fear him,</p><p>both great and small!”</p><p><sup>6</sup>Then I heard what sounded like a great multitude, like the roar of rushing waters and like loud peals of thunder, shouting:</p><p>“Hallelujah!</p><p>For our Lord God Almighty reigns.</p><p><sup>7</sup>Let us rejoice and be glad</p><p>and give him glory!</p><p>For the wedding of the Lamb has come,</p><p>and his bride has made herself ready.</p><p><sup>8</sup>Fine linen, bright and clean,</p><p>was given her to wear.”</p><p>(Fine linen stands for the righteous acts of God’s holy people.)</p>",
