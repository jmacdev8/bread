  "verses": "<p><sup>1</sup>Jesus said to his disciples: “Things that cause people to stumble are bound to come, but woe to anyone through whom they come. <sup>2</sup>It would be better for them to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around their neck than to cause one of these little ones to stumble. <sup>3</sup>So watch yourselves.</p><p>“If your brother or sister sins against you, rebuke them; and if they repent, forgive them. <sup>4</sup>Even if they sin against you seven times in a day and seven times come back to you saying ‘I repent,’ you must forgive them.”</p><p><sup>5</sup>The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!”</p><p><sup>6</sup>He replied, “If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it will obey you.</p>",
