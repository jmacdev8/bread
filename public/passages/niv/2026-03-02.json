  "verses": "<p><sup>22</sup>Then Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in front of the whole assembly of Israel, spread out his hands toward heaven <sup>23</sup>and said:</p><p>“Lord, the God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven above or on earth below—you who keep your covenant of love with your servants who continue wholeheartedly in your way. <sup>24</sup>You have kept your promise to your servant David my father; with your mouth you have promised and with your hand you have fulfilled it—as it is today.</p><p><sup>25</sup>“Now Lord, the God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father the promises you made to him when you said, ‘You shall never fail to have a successor to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your descendants are careful in all they do to walk before me faithfully as you have done.’ <sup>26</sup>And now, God of Israel, let your word that you promised your servant David my father come true.</p><p><sup>27</sup>“But will God really dwell on earth? The heavens, even the highest heaven, cannot contain you. How much less this temple I have built! <sup>28</sup>Yet give attention to your servant’s prayer and his plea for mercy, Lord my God. Hear the cry and the prayer that your servant is praying in your presence this day. <sup>29</sup>May your eyes be open toward this temple night and day, this place of which you said, ‘My Name shall be there,’ so that you will hear the prayer your servant prays toward this place. <sup>30</sup>Hear the supplication of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward this place. Hear from heaven, your dwelling place, and when you hear, forgive.</p>",
