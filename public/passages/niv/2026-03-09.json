  "verses": "<p><sup>22</sup>That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two female servants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. <sup>23</sup>After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions. <sup>24</sup>So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak. <sup>25</sup>When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man. <sup>26</sup>Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.”</p><p>But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”</p><p><sup>27</sup>The man asked him, “What is your name?”</p><p>“Jacob,” he answered.</p><p><sup>28</sup>Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome.”</p><p><sup>29</sup>Jacob said, “Please tell me your name.”</p><p>But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?” Then he blessed him there.</p><p><sup>30</sup>So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, “It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.”</p><p><sup>31</sup>The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel, and he was limping because of his hip. <sup>32</sup>Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob’s hip was touched near the tendon.</p>",
