No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.</p><p><sup>28</sup>“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. <sup>29</sup>Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. <sup>30</sup>For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”</p>",
