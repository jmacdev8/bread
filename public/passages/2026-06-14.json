  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>How lovely is your dwelling place, Lord Almighty! <sup>2</sup>My soul yearns, even faints, for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God. <sup>3</sup>Even the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young— a place near your altar, Lord Almighty, my King and my God. <sup>4</sup>Blessed are those who dwell in your house; they are ever praising you. <sup>5</sup>Blessed are those whose strength is in you, whose hearts are set on pilgrimage. <sup>6</sup>As they pass through the Valley of Baka, they make it a place of springs; the autumn rains also cover it with pools. <sup>7</sup>They go from strength to strength, till each appears before God in Zion. <sup>8</sup>Hear my prayer, Lord God Almighty; listen to me, God of Jacob. <sup>9</sup>Look on our shield, O God; look with favor on your anointed one. <sup>10</sup>Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere; I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked. <sup>11</sup>For the Lord God is a sun and shield; the Lord bestows favor and honor; no good thing does he withhold from those whose walk is blameless. <sup>12</sup>Lord Almighty, blessed is the one who trusts in you.",
