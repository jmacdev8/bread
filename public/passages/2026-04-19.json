  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>I lift up my eyes to the mountains— where does my help come from? <sup>2</sup>My help comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth. <sup>3</sup>He will not let your foot slip— he who watches over you will not slumber; <sup>4</sup>indeed, he who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. <sup>5</sup>The Lord watches over you— the Lord is your shade at your right hand; <sup>6</sup>the sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night. <sup>7</sup>The Lord will keep you from all harm— he will watch over your life; <sup>8</sup>the Lord will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore.",
