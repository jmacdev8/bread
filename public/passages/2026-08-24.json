Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” He answered, “No.” <sup>22</sup>Finally they said, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” <sup>23</sup>John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, “I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way for the Lord.’ ” <sup>24</sup>Now the Pharisees who had been sent <sup>25</sup>questioned him, “Why then do you baptize if you are not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” <sup>26</sup>“I baptize with water,” John replied, “but among you stands one you do not know. <sup>27</sup>He is the one who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.” <sup>28</sup>This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.",
