  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>May God arise, may his enemies be scattered; may his foes flee before him. <sup>2</sup>May you blow them away like smoke— as wax melts before the fire, may the wicked perish before God. <sup>3</sup>But may the righteous be glad and rejoice before God; may they be happy and joyful. <sup>4</sup>Sing to God, sing in praise of his name, extol him who rides on the clouds; rejoice before him—his name is the Lord. <sup>5</sup>A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows, is God in his holy dwelling. <sup>6</sup>God sets the lonely in families, he leads out the prisoners with singing; but the rebellious live in a sun-scorched land. <sup>7</sup>When you, God, went out before your people, when you marched through the wilderness, <sup>8</sup>the earth shook, the heavens poured down rain, before God, the One of Sinai, before God, the God of Israel. <sup>9</sup>You gave abundant showers, O God; you refreshed your weary inheritance. <sup>10</sup>Your people settled in it, and from your bounty, God, you provided for the poor.",
