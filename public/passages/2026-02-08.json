  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Blessed is the one whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. <sup>2</sup>Blessed is the one whose sin the Lord does not count against them and in whose spirit is no deceit. <sup>3</sup>When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. <sup>4</sup>For day and night your hand was heavy on me; my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer. <sup>5</sup>Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity. I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the Lord.” And you forgave the guilt of my sin. <sup>6</sup>Therefore let all the faithful pray to you while you may be found; surely the rising of the mighty waters will not reach them. <sup>7</sup>You are my hiding place; you will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance. <sup>8</sup>I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you with my loving eye on you. <sup>9</sup>Do not be like the horse or the mule, which have no understanding but must be controlled by bit and bridle or they will not come to you. <sup>10</sup>Many are the woes of the wicked, but the Lord’s unfailing love surrounds the one who trusts in him. <sup>11</sup>Rejoice in the Lord and be glad, you righteous; sing, all you who are upright in heart!",
