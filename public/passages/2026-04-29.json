  "verses": "<sup>10</sup>“Hear the word of the Lord, you nations; proclaim it in distant coastlands: ‘He who scattered Israel will gather them and will watch over his flock like a shepherd.’ <sup>11</sup>For the Lord will deliver Jacob and redeem them from the hand of those stronger than they. <sup>12</sup>They will come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion; they will rejoice in the bounty of the Lord— the grain, the new wine and the olive oil, the young of the flocks and herds. They will be like a well-watered garden, and they will sorrow no more. <sup>13</sup>Then young women will dance and be glad, young men and old as well. I will turn their mourning into gladness; I will give them comfort and joy instead of sorrow. <sup>14</sup>I will satisfy the priests with abundance, and my people will be filled with my bounty,” declares the Lord.",
