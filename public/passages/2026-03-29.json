  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Be merciful to me, my God, for my enemies are in hot pursuit; all day long they press their attack. <sup>2</sup>My adversaries pursue me all day long; in their pride many are attacking me. <sup>3</sup>When I am afraid, I put my trust in you. <sup>4</sup>In God, whose word I praise— in God I trust and am not afraid. What can mere mortals do to me? <sup>5</sup>All day long they twist my words; all their schemes are for my ruin. <sup>6</sup>They conspire, they lurk, they watch my steps, hoping to take my life. <sup>7</sup>Because of their wickedness do not let them escape; in your anger, God, bring the nations down. <sup>8</sup>Record my misery; list my tears on your scroll— are they not in your record? <sup>9</sup>Then my enemies will turn back when I call for help. By this I will know that God is for me. <sup>10</sup>In God, whose word I praise, in the Lord, whose word I praise— <sup>11</sup>in God I trust and am not afraid. What can man do to me? <sup>12</sup>I am under vows to you, my God; I will present my thank offerings to you. <sup>13</sup>For you have delivered me from death and my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of life.",
