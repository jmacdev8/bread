  "verses": "<sup>19</sup>When his master heard the story his wife told him, saying, “This is how your slave treated me,” he burned with anger. <sup>20</sup>Joseph’s master took him and put him in prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined. But while Joseph was there in the prison, <sup>21</sup>the Lord was with him; he showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden. <sup>22</sup>So the warden put Joseph in charge of all those held in the prison, and he was made responsible for all that was done there. <sup>23</sup>The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph’s care, because the Lord was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did.",
