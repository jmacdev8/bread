  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands. <sup>2</sup>Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge. <sup>3</sup>They have no speech, they use no words; no sound is heard from them. <sup>4</sup>Yet their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens God has pitched a tent for the sun. <sup>5</sup>It is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, like a champion rejoicing to run his course. <sup>6</sup>It rises at one end of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other; nothing is deprived of its warmth. <sup>7</sup>The law of the Lord is perfect, refreshing the soul. The statutes of the Lord are trustworthy, making wise the simple. <sup>8</sup>The precepts of the Lord are right, giving joy to the heart. The commands of the Lord are radiant, giving light to the eyes. <sup>9</sup>The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring forever. The decrees of the Lord are firm, and all of them are righteous. <sup>10</sup>They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the honeycomb. <sup>11</sup>By them your servant is warned; in keeping them there is great reward. <sup>12</sup>But who can discern their own errors? Forgive my hidden faults. <sup>13</sup>Keep your servant also from willful sins; may they not rule over me. Then I will be blameless, innocent of great transgression. <sup>14</sup>May these words of my mouth and this meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.",
