  "verses": "<sup>23</sup>Before the coming of this faith, we were held in custody under the law, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed. <sup>24</sup>So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith. <sup>25</sup>Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian. <sup>26</sup>So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, <sup>27</sup>for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. <sup>28</sup>There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. <sup>29</sup>If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise. <sup>1</sup>What I am saying is that as long as an heir is underage, he is no different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate. <sup>2</sup>The heir is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father. <sup>3</sup>So also, when we were underage, we were in slavery under the elemental spiritual forces of the world. <sup>4</sup>But when the set time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, <sup>5</sup>to redeem those under the law, that we might receive adoption to sonship. <sup>6</sup>Because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, “Abba, Father.” <sup>7</sup>So you are no longer a slave, but God’s child; and since you are his child, God has made you also an heir.",
