  "verses": "<sup>44</sup>Then Jesus cried out, “Whoever believes in me does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me. <sup>45</sup>The one who looks at me is seeing the one who sent me. <sup>46</sup>I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness. <sup>47</sup>“If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge that person. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world. <sup>48</sup>There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; the very words I have spoken will condemn them at the last day. <sup>49</sup>For I did not speak on my own, but the Father who sent me commanded me to say all that I have spoken. <sup>50</sup>I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say.”",
