  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Answer me when I call to you, my righteous God. Give me relief from my distress; have mercy on me and hear my prayer. <sup>2</sup>How long will you people turn my glory into shame? How long will you love delusions and seek false gods? <sup>3</sup>Know that the Lord has set apart his faithful servant for himself; the Lord hears when I call to him. <sup>4</sup>Tremble and do not sin; when you are on your beds, search your hearts and be silent. <sup>5</sup>Offer the sacrifices of the righteous and trust in the Lord. <sup>6</sup>Many, Lord, are asking, “Who will bring us prosperity?” Let the light of your face shine on us. <sup>7</sup>Fill my heart with joy when their grain and new wine abound. <sup>8</sup>In peace I will lie down and sleep, for you alone, Lord, make me dwell in safety.",
