  "verses": "<sup>9</sup>“To me this is like the days of Noah, when I swore that the waters of Noah would never again cover the earth. So now I have sworn not to be angry with you, never to rebuke you again. <sup>10</sup>Though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed, yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken nor my covenant of peace be removed,” says the Lord, who has compassion on you. <sup>11</sup>“Afflicted city, lashed by storms and not comforted, I will rebuild you with stones of turquoise, your foundations with lapis lazuli. <sup>12</sup>I will make your battlements of rubies, your gates of sparkling jewels, and all your walls of precious stones. <sup>13</sup>All your children will be taught by the Lord, and great will be their peace. <sup>14</sup>In righteousness you will be established: Tyranny will be far from you; you will have nothing to fear. Terror will be far removed; it will not come near you. <sup>15</sup>If anyone does attack you, it will not be my doing; whoever attacks you will surrender to you. <sup>16</sup>“See, it is I who created the blacksmith who fans the coals into flame and forges a weapon fit for its work. And it is I who have created the destroyer to wreak havoc; <sup>17</sup>no weapon forged against you will prevail, and you will refute every tongue that accuses you. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and this is their vindication from me,” declares the Lord.",
