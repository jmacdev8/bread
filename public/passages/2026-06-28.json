  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>To you, Lord, I call; you are my Rock, do not turn a deaf ear to me. For if you remain silent, I will be like those who go down to the pit. <sup>2</sup>Hear my cry for mercy as I call to you for help, as I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place. <sup>3</sup>Do not drag me away with the wicked, with those who do evil, who speak cordially with their neighbors but harbor malice in their hearts. <sup>4</sup>Repay them for their deeds and for their evil work; repay them for what their hands have done and bring back on them what they deserve. <sup>5</sup>Because they have no regard for the deeds of the Lord and what his hands have done, he will tear them down and never build them up again. <sup>6</sup>Praise be to the Lord, for he has heard my cry for mercy. <sup>7</sup>The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and he helps me. My heart leaps for joy, and with my song I praise him. <sup>8</sup>The Lord is the strength of his people, a fortress of salvation for his anointed one. <sup>9</sup>Save your people and bless your inheritance; be their shepherd and carry them forever.",
