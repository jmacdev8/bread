  "verses": "<sup>5</sup>“With whom will you compare me or count me equal? To whom will you liken me that we may be compared? <sup>6</sup>Some pour out gold from their bags and weigh out silver on the scales; they hire a goldsmith to make it into a god, and they bow down and worship it. <sup>7</sup>They lift it to their shoulders and carry it; they set it up in its place, and there it stands. From that spot it cannot move. Even though someone cries out to it, it cannot answer; it cannot save them from their troubles. <sup>8</sup>“Remember this, keep it in mind, take it to heart, you rebels. <sup>9</sup>Remember the former things, those of long ago; I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me. <sup>10</sup>I make known the end from the beginning, from ancient times, what is still to come. I say, ‘My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please.’ <sup>11</sup>From the east I summon a bird of prey; from a far-off land, a man to fulfill my purpose. What I have said, that I will bring about; what I have planned, that I will do.",
