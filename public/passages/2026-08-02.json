  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart. <sup>2</sup>But as for me, my feet had almost slipped; I had nearly lost my foothold. <sup>3</sup>For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. <sup>4</sup>They have no struggles; their bodies are healthy and strong. <sup>5</sup>They are free from common human burdens; they are not plagued by human ills. <sup>6</sup>Therefore pride is their necklace; they clothe themselves with violence. <sup>7</sup>From their callous hearts comes iniquity; their evil imaginations have no limits. <sup>8</sup>They scoff, and speak with malice; with arrogance they threaten oppression. <sup>9</sup>Their mouths lay claim to heaven, and their tongues take possession of the earth. <sup>10</sup>Therefore their people turn to them and drink up waters in abundance. <sup>11</sup>They say, “How would God know? Does the Most High know anything?” <sup>12</sup>This is what the wicked are like— always free of care, they go on amassing wealth. <sup>13</sup>Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure and have washed my hands in innocence. <sup>14</sup>All day long I have been afflicted, and every morning brings new punishments. <sup>15</sup>If I had spoken out like that, I would have betrayed your children. <sup>16</sup>When I tried to understand all this, it troubled me deeply <sup>17</sup>till I entered the sanctuary of God; then I understood their final destiny. <sup>18</sup>Surely you place them on slippery ground; you cast them down to ruin. <sup>19</sup>How suddenly are they destroyed, completely swept away by terrors! <sup>20</sup>They are like a dream when one awakes; when you arise, Lord, you will despise them as fantasies. <sup>21</sup>When my heart was grieved and my spirit embittered, <sup>22</sup>I was senseless and ignorant; I was a brute beast before you. <sup>23</sup>Yet I am always with you; you hold me by my right hand. <sup>24</sup>You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will take me into glory. <sup>25</sup>Whom have I in heaven but you? And earth has nothing I desire besides you. <sup>26</sup>My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. <sup>27</sup>Those who are far from you will perish; you destroy all who are unfaithful to you. <sup>28</sup>But as for me, it is good to be near God. I have made the Sovereign Lord my refuge; I will tell of all your deeds.",
