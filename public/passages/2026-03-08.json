  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>The Lord is my light and my salvation— whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life— of whom shall I be afraid? <sup>2</sup>When the wicked advance against me to devour me, it is my enemies and my foes who will stumble and fall. <sup>3</sup>Though an army besiege me, my heart will not fear; though war break out against me, even then I will be confident. <sup>4</sup>One thing I ask from the Lord, this only do I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to gaze on the beauty of the Lord and to seek him in his temple. <sup>5</sup>For in the day of trouble he will keep me safe in his dwelling; he will hide me in the shelter of his sacred tent and set me high upon a rock. <sup>6</sup>Then my head will be exalted above the enemies who surround me; at his sacred tent I will sacrifice with shouts of joy; I will sing and make music to the Lord. <sup>7</sup>Hear my voice when I call, Lord; be merciful to me and answer me. <sup>8</sup>My heart says of you, “Seek his face!” Your face, Lord, I will seek. <sup>9</sup>Do not hide your face from me, do not turn your servant away in anger; you have been my helper. Do not reject me or forsake me, God my Savior. <sup>10</sup>Though my father and mother forsake me, the Lord will receive me. <sup>11</sup>Teach me your way, Lord; lead me in a straight path because of my oppressors. <sup>12</sup>Do not turn me over to the desire of my foes, for false witnesses rise up against me, spouting malicious accusations. <sup>13</sup>I remain confident of this: I will see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. <sup>14</sup>Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord.",
