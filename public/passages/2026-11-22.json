  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Clap your hands, all you nations; shout to God with cries of joy. <sup>2</sup>For the Lord Most High is awesome, the great King over all the earth. <sup>3</sup>He subdued nations under us, peoples under our feet. <sup>4</sup>He chose our inheritance for us, the pride of Jacob, whom he loved. <sup>5</sup>God has ascended amid shouts of joy, the Lord amid the sounding of trumpets. <sup>6</sup>Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises to our King, sing praises. <sup>7</sup>For God is the King of all the earth; sing to him a psalm of praise. <sup>8</sup>God reigns over the nations; God is seated on his holy throne. <sup>9</sup>The nobles of the nations assemble as the people of the God of Abraham, for the kings of the earth belong to God; he is greatly exalted.",
