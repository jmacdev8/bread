  "verses": "<sup>24</sup>A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest. <sup>25</sup>Jesus said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors. <sup>26</sup>But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves. <sup>27</sup>For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves. <sup>28</sup>You are those who have stood by me in my trials. <sup>29</sup>And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me, <sup>30</sup>so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.",
