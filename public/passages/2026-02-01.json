  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Ascribe to the Lord, you heavenly beings, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength. <sup>2</sup>Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name; worship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness. <sup>3</sup>The voice of the Lord is over the waters; the God of glory thunders, the Lord thunders over the mighty waters. <sup>4</sup>The voice of the Lord is powerful; the voice of the Lord is majestic. <sup>5</sup>The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars; the Lord breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon. <sup>6</sup>He makes Lebanon leap like a calf, Sirion like a young wild ox. <sup>7</sup>The voice of the Lord strikes with flashes of lightning. <sup>8</sup>The voice of the Lord shakes the desert; the Lord shakes the Desert of Kadesh. <sup>9</sup>The voice of the Lord twists the oaks and strips the forests bare. And in his temple all cry, “Glory!” <sup>10</sup>The Lord sits enthroned over the flood; the Lord is enthroned as King forever. <sup>11</sup>The Lord gives strength to his people; the Lord blesses his people with peace.",
