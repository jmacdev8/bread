  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Sing joyfully to the Lord, you righteous; it is fitting for the upright to praise him. <sup>2</sup>Praise the Lord with the harp; make music to him on the ten-stringed lyre. <sup>3</sup>Sing to him a new song; play skillfully, and shout for joy. <sup>4</sup>For the word of the Lord is right and true; he is faithful in all he does. <sup>5</sup>The Lord loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of his unfailing love. <sup>6</sup>By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth. <sup>7</sup>He gathers the waters of the sea into jars; he puts the deep into storehouses. <sup>8</sup>Let all the earth fear the Lord; let all the people of the world revere him. <sup>9</sup>For he spoke, and it came to be; he commanded, and it stood firm. <sup>10</sup>The Lord foils the plans of the nations; he thwarts the purposes of the peoples. <sup>11</sup>But the plans of the Lord stand firm forever, the purposes of his heart through all generations. <sup>12</sup>Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, the people he chose for his inheritance. <sup>13</sup>From heaven the Lord looks down and sees all mankind; <sup>14</sup>from his dwelling place he watches all who live on earth— <sup>15</sup>he who forms the hearts of all, who considers everything they do. <sup>16</sup>No king is saved by the size of his army; no warrior escapes by his great strength. <sup>17</sup>A horse is a vain hope for deliverance; despite all its great strength it cannot save. <sup>18</sup>But the eyes of the Lord are on those who fear him, on those whose hope is in his unfailing love, <sup>19</sup>to deliver them from death and keep them alive in famine. <sup>20</sup>We wait in hope for the Lord; he is our help and our shield. <sup>21</sup>In him our hearts rejoice, for we trust in his holy name. <sup>22</sup>May your unfailing love be with us, Lord, even as we put our hope in you.",
