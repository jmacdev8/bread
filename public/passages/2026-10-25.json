  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>You have searched me, Lord, and you know me. <sup>2</sup>You know when I sit and when I rise; you perceive my thoughts from afar. <sup>3</sup>You discern my going out and my lying down; you are familiar with all my ways. <sup>4</sup>Before a word is on my tongue you, Lord, know it completely. <sup>5</sup>You hem me in behind and before, and you lay your hand upon me. <sup>6</sup>Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain. <sup>7</sup>Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? <sup>8</sup>If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there. <sup>9</sup>If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea, <sup>10</sup>even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast. <sup>11</sup>If I say, “Surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night around me,” <sup>12</sup>even the darkness will not be dark to you; the night will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to you. <sup>13</sup>For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb. <sup>14</sup>I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well. <sup>15</sup>My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place, when I was woven together in the depths of the earth. <sup>16</sup>Your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be. <sup>17</sup>How precious to me are your thoughts, God! How vast is the sum of them! <sup>18</sup>Were I to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand— when I awake, I am still with you. <sup>19</sup>If only you, God, would slay the wicked! Away from me, you who are bloodthirsty! <sup>20</sup>They speak of you with evil intent; your adversaries misuse your name. <sup>21</sup>Do I not hate those who hate you, Lord, and abhor those who are in rebellion against you? <sup>22</sup>I have nothing but hatred for them; I count them my enemies. <sup>23</sup>Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. <sup>24</sup>See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.",
