  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dreamed. <sup>2</sup>Our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with songs of joy. Then it was said among the nations, “The Lord has done great things for them.” <sup>3</sup>The Lord has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy. <sup>4</sup>Restore our fortunes, Lord, like streams in the Negev. <sup>5</sup>Those who sow with tears will reap with songs of joy. <sup>6</sup>Those who go out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with them.",
