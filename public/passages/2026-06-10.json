  "verses": "<sup>53</sup>When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there. <sup>54</sup>Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. “Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?” they asked. <sup>55</sup>“Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother’s name Mary, and aren’t his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas? <sup>56</sup>Aren’t all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?” <sup>57</sup>And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own home.” <sup>58</sup>And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.",
