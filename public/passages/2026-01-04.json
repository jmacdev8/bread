  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>I will sing of the Lord’s great love forever; with my mouth I will make your faithfulness known through all generations. <sup>2</sup>I will declare that your love stands firm forever, that you have established your faithfulness in heaven itself. <sup>3</sup>You said, “I have made a covenant with my chosen one, I have sworn to David my servant, <sup>4</sup>‘I will establish your line forever and make your throne firm through all generations.’ ” <sup>5</sup>The heavens praise your wonders, Lord, your faithfulness too, in the assembly of the holy ones. <sup>6</sup>For who in the skies above can compare with the Lord? Who is like the Lord among the heavenly beings? <sup>7</sup>In the council of the holy ones God is greatly feared; he is more awesome than all who surround him. <sup>8</sup>Who is like you, Lord God Almighty? You, Lord, are mighty, and your faithfulness surrounds you. <sup>9</sup>You rule over the surging sea; when its waves mount up, you still them. <sup>10</sup>You crushed Rahab like one of the slain; with your strong arm you scattered your enemies. <sup>11</sup>The heavens are yours, and yours also the earth; you founded the world and all that is in it. <sup>12</sup>You created the north and the south; Tabor and Hermon sing for joy at your name. <sup>13</sup>Your arm is endowed with power; your hand is strong, your right hand exalted. <sup>14</sup>Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; love and faithfulness go before you. <sup>15</sup>Blessed are those who have learned to acclaim you, who walk in the light of your presence, Lord. <sup>16</sup>They rejoice in your name all day long; they celebrate your righteousness. <sup>17</sup>For you are their glory and strength, and by your favor you exalt our horn. <sup>18</sup>Indeed, our shield belongs to the Lord, our king to the Holy One of Israel.",
