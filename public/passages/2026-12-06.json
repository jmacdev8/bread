  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Truly my soul finds rest in God; my salvation comes from him. <sup>2</sup>Truly he is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will never be shaken. <sup>3</sup>How long will you assault me? Would all of you throw me down— this leaning wall, this tottering fence? <sup>4</sup>Surely they intend to topple me from my lofty place; they take delight in lies. With their mouths they bless, but in their hearts they curse. <sup>5</sup>Yes, my soul, find rest in God; my hope comes from him. <sup>6</sup>Truly he is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will not be shaken. <sup>7</sup>My salvation and my honor depend on God; he is my mighty rock, my refuge. <sup>8</sup>Trust in him at all times, you people; pour out your hearts to him, for God is our refuge. <sup>9</sup>Surely the lowborn are but a breath, the highborn are but a lie. If weighed on a balance, they are nothing; together they are only a breath. <sup>10</sup>Do not trust in extortion or put vain hope in stolen goods; though your riches increase, do not set your heart on them. <sup>11</sup>One thing God has spoken, two things I have heard: “Power belongs to you, God, <sup>12</sup>and with you, Lord, is unfailing love”; and, “You reward everyone according to what they have done.”",
