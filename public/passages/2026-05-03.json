  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>I will extol the Lord at all times; his praise will always be on my lips. <sup>2</sup>I will glory in the Lord; let the afflicted hear and rejoice. <sup>3</sup>Glorify the Lord with me; let us exalt his name together. <sup>4</sup>I sought the Lord, and he answered me; he delivered me from all my fears. <sup>5</sup>Those who look to him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame. <sup>6</sup>This poor man called, and the Lord heard him; he saved him out of all his troubles. <sup>7</sup>The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him, and he delivers them. <sup>8</sup>Taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the one who takes refuge in him. <sup>9</sup>Fear the Lord, you his holy people, for those who fear him lack nothing. <sup>10</sup>The lions may grow weak and hungry, but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing. <sup>11</sup>Come, my children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord. <sup>12</sup>Whoever of you loves life and desires to see many good days, <sup>13</sup>keep your tongue from evil and your lips from telling lies. <sup>14</sup>Turn from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it. <sup>15</sup>The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are attentive to their cry; <sup>16</sup>but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil, to blot out their name from the earth. <sup>17</sup>The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears them; he delivers them from all their troubles. <sup>18</sup>The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. <sup>19</sup>The righteous person may have many troubles, but the Lord delivers him from them all; <sup>20</sup>he protects all his bones, not one of them will be broken. <sup>21</sup>Evil will slay the wicked; the foes of the righteous will be condemned. <sup>22</sup>The Lord will rescue his servants; no one who takes refuge in him will be condemned.",
