  "verses": "<sup>10</sup>Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the instruction of our God, you people of Gomorrah! <sup>11</sup>“The multitude of your sacrifices— what are they to me?” says the Lord. “I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats. <sup>12</sup>When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts? <sup>13</sup>Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations— I cannot bear your worthless assemblies. <sup>14</sup>Your New Moon feasts and your appointed festivals I hate with all my being. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them. <sup>15</sup>When you spread out your hands in prayer, I hide my eyes from you; even when you offer many prayers, I am not listening. Your hands are full of blood! <sup>16</sup>Wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight; stop doing wrong. <sup>17</sup>Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow.",
