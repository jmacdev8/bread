  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>As God’s co-workers we urge you not to receive God’s grace in vain. <sup>2</sup>For he says, “In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.” I tell you, now is the time of God’s favor, now is the day of salvation. <sup>3</sup>We put no stumbling block in anyone’s path, so that our ministry will not be discredited. <sup>4</sup>Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great endurance; in troubles, hardships and distresses; <sup>5</sup>in beatings, imprisonments and riots; in hard work, sleepless nights and hunger; <sup>6</sup>in purity, understanding, patience and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love; <sup>7</sup>in truthful speech and in the power of God; with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left; <sup>8</sup>through glory and dishonor, bad report and good report; genuine, yet regarded as impostors; <sup>9</sup>known, yet regarded as unknown; dying, and yet we live on; beaten, and yet not killed; <sup>10</sup>sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything. <sup>11</sup>We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians, and opened wide our hearts to you. <sup>12</sup>We are not withholding our affection from you, but you are withholding yours from us. <sup>13</sup>As a fair exchange—I speak as to my children—open wide your hearts also.",
