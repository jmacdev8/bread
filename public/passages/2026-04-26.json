  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Hear us, Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock. You who sit enthroned between the cherubim, shine forth <sup>2</sup>before Ephraim, Benjamin and Manasseh. Awaken your might; come and save us. <sup>3</sup>Restore us, O God; make your face shine on us, that we may be saved. <sup>4</sup>How long, Lord God Almighty, will your anger smolder against the prayers of your people? <sup>5</sup>You have fed them with the bread of tears; you have made them drink tears by the bowlful. <sup>6</sup>You have made us an object of derision to our neighbors, and our enemies mock us. <sup>7</sup>Restore us, God Almighty; make your face shine on us, that we may be saved. <sup>8</sup>You transplanted a vine from Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it. <sup>9</sup>You cleared the ground for it, and it took root and filled the land. <sup>10</sup>The mountains were covered with its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches. <sup>11</sup>Its branches reached as far as the Sea, its shoots as far as the River. <sup>12</sup>Why have you broken down its walls so that all who pass by pick its grapes? <sup>13</sup>Boars from the forest ravage it, and insects from the fields feed on it. <sup>14</sup>Return to us, God Almighty! Look down from heaven and see! Watch over this vine, <sup>15</sup>the root your right hand has planted, the son you have raised up for yourself. <sup>16</sup>Your vine is cut down, it is burned with fire; at your rebuke your people perish. <sup>17</sup>Let your hand rest on the man at your right hand, the son of man you have raised up for yourself. <sup>18</sup>Then we will not turn away from you; revive us, and we will call on your name. <sup>19</sup>Restore us, Lord God Almighty; make your face shine on us, that we may be saved.",
