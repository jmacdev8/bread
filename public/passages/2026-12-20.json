  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Praise awaits you, our God, in Zion; to you our vows will be fulfilled. <sup>2</sup>You who answer prayer, to you all people will come. <sup>3</sup>When we were overwhelmed by sins, you forgave our transgressions. <sup>4</sup>Blessed are those you choose and bring near to live in your courts! We are filled with the good things of your house, of your holy temple. <sup>5</sup>You answer us with awesome and righteous deeds, God our Savior, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas, <sup>6</sup>who formed the mountains by your power, having armed yourself with strength, <sup>7</sup>who stilled the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the turmoil of the nations. <sup>8</sup>The whole earth is filled with awe at your wonders; where morning dawns, where evening fades, you call forth songs of joy. <sup>9</sup>You care for the land and water it; you enrich it abundantly. The streams of God are filled with water to provide the people with grain, for so you have ordained it. <sup>10</sup>You drench its furrows and level its ridges; you soften it with showers and bless its crops. <sup>11</sup>You crown the year with your bounty, and your carts overflow with abundance. <sup>12</sup>The grasslands of the wilderness overflow; the hills are clothed with gladness. <sup>13</sup>The meadows are covered with flocks and the valleys are mantled with grain; they shout for joy and sing.",
