  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>I waited patiently for the Lord; he turned to me and heard my cry. <sup>2</sup>He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand. <sup>3</sup>He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear the Lord and put their trust in him. <sup>4</sup>Blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord, who does not look to the proud, to those who turn aside to false gods. <sup>5</sup>Many, Lord my God, are the wonders you have done, the things you planned for us. None can compare with you; were I to speak and tell of your deeds, they would be too many to declare. <sup>6</sup>Sacrifice and offering you did not desire— but my ears you have opened— burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not require. <sup>7</sup>Then I said, “Here I am, I have come— it is written about me in the scroll. <sup>8</sup>I desire to do your will, my God; your law is within my heart.” <sup>9</sup>I proclaim your saving acts in the great assembly; I do not seal my lips, Lord, as you know. <sup>10</sup>I do not hide your righteousness in my heart; I speak of your faithfulness and your saving help. I do not conceal your love and your faithfulness from the great assembly. <sup>11</sup>Do not withhold your mercy from me, Lord; may your love and faithfulness always protect me. <sup>12</sup>For troubles without number surround me; my sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart fails within me. <sup>13</sup>Be pleased to save me, Lord; come quickly, Lord, to help me. <sup>14</sup>May all who want to take my life be put to shame and confusion; may all who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace. <sup>15</sup>May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!” be appalled at their own shame. <sup>16</sup>But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who long for your saving help always say, “The Lord is great!” <sup>17</sup>But as for me, I am poor and needy; may the Lord think of me. You are my help and my deliverer; you are my God, do not delay.",
