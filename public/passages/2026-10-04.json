  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>It is good to praise the Lord and make music to your name, O Most High, <sup>2</sup>proclaiming your love in the morning and your faithfulness at night, <sup>3</sup>to the music of the ten-stringed lyre and the melody of the harp. <sup>4</sup>For you make me glad by your deeds, Lord; I sing for joy at what your hands have done. <sup>5</sup>How great are your works, Lord, how profound your thoughts! <sup>6</sup>Senseless people do not know, fools do not understand, <sup>7</sup>that though the wicked spring up like grass and all evildoers flourish, they will be destroyed forever. <sup>8</sup>But you, Lord, are forever exalted. <sup>9</sup>For surely your enemies, Lord, surely your enemies will perish; all evildoers will be scattered. <sup>10</sup>You have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox; fine oils have been poured on me. <sup>11</sup>My eyes have seen the defeat of my adversaries; my ears have heard the rout of my wicked foes. <sup>12</sup>The righteous will flourish like a palm tree, they will grow like a cedar of Lebanon; <sup>13</sup>planted in the house of the Lord, they will flourish in the courts of our God. <sup>14</sup>They will still bear fruit in old age, they will stay fresh and green, <sup>15</sup>proclaiming, “The Lord is upright; he is my Rock, and there is no wickedness in him.”",
