  "verses": "<sup>67</sup>His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied: <sup>68</sup>“Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come to his people and redeemed them. <sup>69</sup>He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David <sup>70</sup>(as he said through his holy prophets of long ago), <sup>71</sup>salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us— <sup>72</sup>to show mercy to our ancestors and to remember his holy covenant, <sup>73</sup>the oath he swore to our father Abraham: <sup>74</sup>to rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him without fear <sup>75</sup>in holiness and righteousness before him all our days. <sup>76</sup>And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him, <sup>77</sup>to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins, <sup>78</sup>because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven <sup>79</sup>to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace.” <sup>80</sup>And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the wilderness until he appeared publicly to Israel.",
