  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>“Come, let us return to the Lord. He has torn us to pieces but he will heal us; he has injured us but he will bind up our wounds. <sup>2</sup>After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will restore us, that we may live in his presence. <sup>3</sup>Let us acknowledge the Lord; let us press on to acknowledge him. As surely as the sun rises, he will appear; he will come to us like the winter rains, like the spring rains that water the earth.” <sup>4</sup>“What can I do with you, Ephraim? What can I do with you, Judah? Your love is like the morning mist, like the early dew that disappears. <sup>5</sup>Therefore I cut you in pieces with my prophets, I killed you with the words of my mouth— then my judgments go forth like the sun. <sup>6</sup>For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgment of God rather than burnt offerings.",
