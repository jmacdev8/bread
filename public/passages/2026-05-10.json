  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Blessed are all who fear the Lord, who walk in obedience to him. <sup>2</sup>You will eat the fruit of your labor; blessings and prosperity will be yours. <sup>3</sup>Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house; your children will be like olive shoots around your table. <sup>4</sup>Yes, this will be the blessing for the man who fears the Lord. <sup>5</sup>May the Lord bless you from Zion; may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life. <sup>6</sup>May you live to see your children’s children— peace be on Israel.",
