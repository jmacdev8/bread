  "verses": "<sup>12</sup>Therefore, strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees. <sup>13</sup>“Make level paths for your feet,” so that the lame may not be disabled, but rather healed. <sup>14</sup>Make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord. <sup>15</sup>See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many. <sup>16</sup>See that no one is sexually immoral, or is godless like Esau, who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights as the oldest son. <sup>17</sup>Afterward, as you know, when he wanted to inherit this blessing, he was rejected. Even though he sought the blessing with tears, he could not change what he had done.",
