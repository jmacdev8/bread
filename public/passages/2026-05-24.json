  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Praise the Lord, my soul. Lord my God, you are very great; you are clothed with splendor and majesty. <sup>2</sup>The Lord wraps himself in light as with a garment; he stretches out the heavens like a tent <sup>3</sup>and lays the beams of his upper chambers on their waters. He makes the clouds his chariot and rides on the wings of the wind. <sup>4</sup>He makes winds his messengers, flames of fire his servants. <sup>5</sup>He set the earth on its foundations; it can never be moved. <sup>6</sup>You covered it with the watery depths as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains. <sup>7</sup>But at your rebuke the waters fled, at the sound of your thunder they took to flight; <sup>8</sup>they flowed over the mountains, they went down into the valleys, to the place you assigned for them. <sup>9</sup>You set a boundary they cannot cross; never again will they cover the earth. <sup>10</sup>He makes springs pour water into the ravines; it flows between the mountains. <sup>11</sup>They give water to all the beasts of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst. <sup>12</sup>The birds of the sky nest by the waters; they sing among the branches. <sup>13</sup>He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the land is satisfied by the fruit of his work. <sup>14</sup>He makes grass grow for the cattle, and plants for people to cultivate— bringing forth food from the earth: <sup>15</sup>wine that gladdens human hearts, oil to make their faces shine, and bread that sustains their hearts. <sup>16</sup>The trees of the Lord are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted. <sup>17</sup>There the birds make their nests; the stork has its home in the junipers. <sup>18</sup>The high mountains belong to the wild goats; the crags are a refuge for the hyrax. <sup>19</sup>He made the moon to mark the seasons, and the sun knows when to go down. <sup>20</sup>You bring darkness, it becomes night, and all the beasts of the forest prowl. <sup>21</sup>The lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God. <sup>22</sup>The sun rises, and they steal away; they return and lie down in their dens. <sup>23</sup>Then people go out to their work, to their labor until evening. <sup>24</sup>How many are your works, Lord! In wisdom you made them all; the earth is full of your creatures. <sup>25</sup>There is the sea, vast and spacious, teeming with creatures beyond number— living things both large and small. <sup>26</sup>There the ships go to and fro, and Leviathan, which you formed to frolic there. <sup>27</sup>All creatures look to you to give them their food at the proper time. <sup>28</sup>When you give it to them, they gather it up; when you open your hand, they are satisfied with good things. <sup>29</sup>When you hide your face, they are terrified; when you take away their breath, they die and return to the dust. <sup>30</sup>When you send your Spirit, they are created, and you renew the face of the ground. <sup>31</sup>May the glory of the Lord endure forever; may the Lord rejoice in his works— <sup>32</sup>he who looks at the earth, and it trembles, who touches the mountains, and they smoke. <sup>33</sup>I will sing to the Lord all my life; I will sing praise to my God as long as I live. <sup>34</sup>May my meditation be pleasing to him, as I rejoice in the Lord. <sup>35</sup>But may sinners vanish from the earth and the wicked be no more. Praise the Lord, my soul. Praise the Lord.",
