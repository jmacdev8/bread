  "verses": "<sup>8</sup>Finally, all of you, be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble. <sup>9</sup>Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary, repay evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing. <sup>10</sup>For, “Whoever would love life and see good days must keep their tongue from evil and their lips from deceitful speech. <sup>11</sup>They must turn from evil and do good; they must seek peace and pursue it. <sup>12</sup>For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”",
