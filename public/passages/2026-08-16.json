  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>I will exalt you, my God the King; I will praise your name for ever and ever. <sup>2</sup>Every day I will praise you and extol your name for ever and ever. <sup>3</sup>Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise; his greatness no one can fathom. <sup>4</sup>One generation commends your works to another; they tell of your mighty acts. <sup>5</sup>They speak of the glorious splendor of your majesty— and I will meditate on your wonderful works. <sup>6</sup>They tell of the power of your awesome works— and I will proclaim your great deeds. <sup>7</sup>They celebrate your abundant goodness and joyfully sing of your righteousness. <sup>8</sup>The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in love. <sup>9</sup>The Lord is good to all; he has compassion on all he has made. <sup>10</sup>All your works praise you, Lord; your faithful people extol you. <sup>11</sup>They tell of the glory of your kingdom and speak of your might, <sup>12</sup>so that all people may know of your mighty acts and the glorious splendor of your kingdom. <sup>13</sup>Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and your dominion endures through all generations. The Lord is trustworthy in all he promises and faithful in all he does. <sup>14</sup>The Lord upholds all who fall and lifts up all who are bowed down. <sup>15</sup>The eyes of all look to you, and you give them their food at the proper time. <sup>16</sup>You open your hand and satisfy the desires of every living thing. <sup>17</sup>The Lord is righteous in all his ways and faithful in all he does. <sup>18</sup>The Lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth. <sup>19</sup>He fulfills the desires of those who fear him; he hears their cry and saves them. <sup>20</sup>The Lord watches over all who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy. <sup>21</sup>My mouth will speak in praise of the Lord. Let every creature praise his holy name for ever and ever.",
