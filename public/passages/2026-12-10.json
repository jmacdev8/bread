  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>For Zion’s sake I will not keep silent, for Jerusalem’s sake I will not remain quiet, till her vindication shines out like the dawn, her salvation like a blazing torch. <sup>2</sup>The nations will see your vindication, and all kings your glory; you will be called by a new name that the mouth of the Lord will bestow. <sup>3</sup>You will be a crown of splendor in the Lord’s hand, a royal diadem in the hand of your God. <sup>4</sup>No longer will they call you Deserted, or name your land Desolate. But you will be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah; for the Lord will take delight in you, and your land will be married. <sup>5</sup>As a young man marries a young woman, so will your Builder marry you; as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so will your God rejoice over you. <sup>6</sup>I have posted watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem; they will never be silent day or night. You who call on the Lord, give yourselves no rest, <sup>7</sup>and give him no rest till he establishes Jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth. <sup>8</sup>The Lord has sworn by his right hand and by his mighty arm: “Never again will I give your grain as food for your enemies, and never again will foreigners drink the new wine for which you have toiled; <sup>9</sup>but those who harvest it will eat it and praise the Lord, and those who gather the grapes will drink it in the courts of my sanctuary.” <sup>10</sup>Pass through, pass through the gates! Prepare the way for the people. Build up, build up the highway! Remove the stones. Raise a banner for the nations. <sup>11</sup>The Lord has made proclamation to the ends of the earth: “Say to Daughter Zion, ‘See, your Savior comes! See, his reward is with him, and his recompense accompanies him.’ ” <sup>12</sup>They will be called the Holy People, the Redeemed of the Lord; and you will be called Sought After, the City No Longer Deserted.",
