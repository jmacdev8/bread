  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness. <sup>2</sup>These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John; <sup>3</sup>Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; <sup>4</sup>Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. <sup>5</sup>These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: “Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. <sup>6</sup>Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. <sup>7</sup>As you go, proclaim this message: ‘The kingdom of heaven has come near.’ <sup>8</sup>Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give. <sup>9</sup>“Do not get any gold or silver or copper to take with you in your belts— <sup>10</sup>no bag for the journey or extra shirt or sandals or a staff, for the worker is worth his keep. <sup>11</sup>Whatever town or village you enter, search there for some worthy person and stay at their house until you leave. <sup>12</sup>As you enter the home, give it your greeting. <sup>13</sup>If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you. <sup>14</sup>If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet. <sup>15</sup>Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.",
