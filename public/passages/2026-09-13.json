  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>I call to you, Lord, come quickly to me; hear me when I call to you. <sup>2</sup>May my prayer be set before you like incense; may the lifting up of my hands be like the evening sacrifice. <sup>3</sup>Set a guard over my mouth, Lord; keep watch over the door of my lips. <sup>4</sup>Do not let my heart be drawn to what is evil so that I take part in wicked deeds along with those who are evildoers; do not let me eat their delicacies. <sup>5</sup>Let a righteous man strike me—that is a kindness; let him rebuke me—that is oil on my head. My head will not refuse it, for my prayer will still be against the deeds of evildoers. <sup>6</sup>Their rulers will be thrown down from the cliffs, and the wicked will learn that my words were well spoken. <sup>7</sup>They will say, “As one plows and breaks up the earth, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of the grave.” <sup>8</sup>But my eyes are fixed on you, Sovereign Lord; in you I take refuge—do not give me over to death. <sup>9</sup>Keep me safe from the traps set by evildoers, from the snares they have laid for me. <sup>10</sup>Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by in safety.",
