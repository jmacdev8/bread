  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Lord, you have been our dwelling place throughout all generations. <sup>2</sup>Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God. <sup>3</sup>You turn people back to dust, saying, “Return to dust, you mortals.” <sup>4</sup>A thousand years in your sight are like a day that has just gone by, or like a watch in the night. <sup>5</sup>Yet you sweep people away in the sleep of death— they are like the new grass of the morning: <sup>6</sup>In the morning it springs up new, but by evening it is dry and withered. <sup>7</sup>We are consumed by your anger and terrified by your indignation. <sup>8</sup>You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence. <sup>9</sup>All our days pass away under your wrath; we finish our years with a moan. <sup>10</sup>Our days may come to seventy years, or eighty, if our strength endures; yet the best of them are but trouble and sorrow, for they quickly pass, and we fly away. <sup>11</sup>If only we knew the power of your anger! Your wrath is as great as the fear that is your due. <sup>12</sup>Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom. <sup>13</sup>Relent, Lord! How long will it be? Have compassion on your servants. <sup>14</sup>Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days. <sup>15</sup>Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen trouble. <sup>16</sup>May your deeds be shown to your servants, your splendor to their children. <sup>17</sup>May the favor of the Lord our God rest on us; establish the work of our hands for us— yes, establish the work of our hands.",
