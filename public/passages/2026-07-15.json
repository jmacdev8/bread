  "verses": "<sup>21</sup>See how the faithful city has become a prostitute! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her— but now murderers! <sup>22</sup>Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water. <sup>23</sup>Your rulers are rebels, partners with thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow’s case does not come before them. <sup>24</sup>Therefore the Lord, the Lord Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: “Ah! I will vent my wrath on my foes and avenge myself on my enemies. <sup>25</sup>I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities. <sup>26</sup>I will restore your leaders as in days of old, your rulers as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City.”",
