  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Sing to the Lord a new song; sing to the Lord, all the earth. <sup>2</sup>Sing to the Lord, praise his name; proclaim his salvation day after day. <sup>3</sup>Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous deeds among all peoples. <sup>4</sup>For great is the Lord and most worthy of praise; he is to be feared above all gods. <sup>5</sup>For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord made the heavens. <sup>6</sup>Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and glory are in his sanctuary. <sup>7</sup>Ascribe to the Lord, all you families of nations, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength. <sup>8</sup>Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name; bring an offering and come into his courts. <sup>9</sup>Worship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness; tremble before him, all the earth. <sup>10</sup>Say among the nations, “The Lord reigns.” The world is firmly established, it cannot be moved; he will judge the peoples with equity. <sup>11</sup>Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth be glad; let the sea resound, and all that is in it. <sup>12</sup>Let the fields be jubilant, and everything in them; let all the trees of the forest sing for joy. <sup>13</sup>Let all creation rejoice before the Lord, for he comes, he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples in his faithfulness.",
