  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>“All this I have told you so that you will not fall away. <sup>2</sup>They will put you out of the synagogue; in fact, the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering a service to God. <sup>3</sup>They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me. <sup>4</sup>I have told you this, so that when their time comes you will remember that I warned you about them. I did not tell you this from the beginning because I was with you, <sup>5</sup>but now I am going to him who sent me. None of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’ <sup>6</sup>Rather, you are filled with grief because I have said these things. <sup>7</sup>But very truly I tell you, it is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. <sup>8</sup>When he comes, he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment: <sup>9</sup>about sin, because people do not believe in me; <sup>10</sup>about righteousness, because I am going to the Father, where you can see me no longer; <sup>11</sup>and about judgment, because the prince of this world now stands condemned.",
