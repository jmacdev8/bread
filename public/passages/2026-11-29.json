  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>The Lord reigns, let the earth be glad; let the distant shores rejoice. <sup>2</sup>Clouds and thick darkness surround him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne. <sup>3</sup>Fire goes before him and consumes his foes on every side. <sup>4</sup>His lightning lights up the world; the earth sees and trembles. <sup>5</sup>The mountains melt like wax before the Lord, before the Lord of all the earth. <sup>6</sup>The heavens proclaim his righteousness, and all peoples see his glory. <sup>7</sup>All who worship images are put to shame, those who boast in idols— worship him, all you gods! <sup>8</sup>Zion hears and rejoices and the villages of Judah are glad because of your judgments, Lord. <sup>9</sup>For you, Lord, are the Most High over all the earth; you are exalted far above all gods. <sup>10</sup>Let those who love the Lord hate evil, for he guards the lives of his faithful ones and delivers them from the hand of the wicked. <sup>11</sup>Light shines on the righteous and joy on the upright in heart. <sup>12</sup>Rejoice in the Lord, you who are righteous, and praise his holy name.",
