  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever. <sup>2</sup>Let the redeemed of the Lord tell their story— those he redeemed from the hand of the foe, <sup>3</sup>those he gathered from the lands, from east and west, from north and south. <sup>4</sup>Some wandered in desert wastelands, finding no way to a city where they could settle. <sup>5</sup>They were hungry and thirsty, and their lives ebbed away. <sup>6</sup>Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress. <sup>7</sup>He led them by a straight way to a city where they could settle. <sup>8</sup>Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind, <sup>9</sup>for he satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things. <sup>10</sup>Some sat in darkness, in utter darkness, prisoners suffering in iron chains, <sup>11</sup>because they rebelled against God’s commands and despised the plans of the Most High. <sup>12</sup>So he subjected them to bitter labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help. <sup>13</sup>Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress. <sup>14</sup>He brought them out of darkness, the utter darkness, and broke away their chains. <sup>15</sup>Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind, <sup>16</sup>for he breaks down gates of bronze and cuts through bars of iron. <sup>17</sup>Some became fools through their rebellious ways and suffered affliction because of their iniquities. <sup>18</sup>They loathed all food and drew near the gates of death. <sup>19</sup>Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress. <sup>20</sup>He sent out his word and healed them; he rescued them from the grave. <sup>21</sup>Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind. <sup>22</sup>Let them sacrifice thank offerings and tell of his works with songs of joy. <sup>23</sup>Some went out on the sea in ships; they were merchants on the mighty waters. <sup>24</sup>They saw the works of the Lord, his wonderful deeds in the deep. <sup>25</sup>For he spoke and stirred up a tempest that lifted high the waves. <sup>26</sup>They mounted up to the heavens and went down to the depths; in their peril their courage melted away. <sup>27</sup>They reeled and staggered like drunkards; they were at their wits’ end. <sup>28</sup>Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distress. <sup>29</sup>He stilled the storm to a whisper; the waves of the sea were hushed. <sup>30</sup>They were glad when it grew calm, and he guided them to their desired haven. <sup>31</sup>Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind. <sup>32</sup>Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people and praise him in the council of the elders. <sup>33</sup>He turned rivers into a desert, flowing springs into thirsty ground, <sup>34</sup>and fruitful land into a salt waste, because of the wickedness of those who lived there. <sup>35</sup>He turned the desert into pools of water and the parched ground into flowing springs; <sup>36</sup>there he brought the hungry to live, and they founded a city where they could settle. <sup>37</sup>They sowed fields and planted vineyards that yielded a fruitful harvest; <sup>38</sup>he blessed them, and their numbers greatly increased, and he did not let their herds diminish. <sup>39</sup>Then their numbers decreased, and they were humbled by oppression, calamity and sorrow; <sup>40</sup>he who pours contempt on nobles made them wander in a trackless waste. <sup>41</sup>But he lifted the needy out of their affliction and increased their families like flocks. <sup>42</sup>The upright see and rejoice, but all the wicked shut their mouths. <sup>43</sup>Let the one who is wise heed these things and ponder the loving deeds of the Lord.",
