  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Praise the Lord, my soul; all my inmost being, praise his holy name. <sup>2</sup>Praise the Lord, my soul, and forget not all his benefits— <sup>3</sup>who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases, <sup>4</sup>who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion, <sup>5</sup>who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s. <sup>6</sup>The Lord works righteousness and justice for all the oppressed. <sup>7</sup>He made known his ways to Moses, his deeds to the people of Israel: <sup>8</sup>The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love. <sup>9</sup>He will not always accuse, nor will he harbor his anger forever; <sup>10</sup>he does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities. <sup>11</sup>For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him; <sup>12</sup>as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us. <sup>13</sup>As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him; <sup>14</sup>for he knows how we are formed, he remembers that we are dust. <sup>15</sup>The life of mortals is like grass, they flourish like a flower of the field; <sup>16</sup>the wind blows over it and it is gone, and its place remembers it no more. <sup>17</sup>But from everlasting to everlasting the Lord’s love is with those who fear him, and his righteousness with their children’s children— <sup>18</sup>with those who keep his covenant and remember to obey his precepts. <sup>19</sup>The Lord has established his throne in heaven, and his kingdom rules over all. <sup>20</sup>Praise the Lord, you his angels, you mighty ones who do his bidding, who obey his word. <sup>21</sup>Praise the Lord, all his heavenly hosts, you his servants who do his will. <sup>22</sup>Praise the Lord, all his works everywhere in his dominion. Praise the Lord, my soul.",
