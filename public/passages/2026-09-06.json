  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Out of the depths I cry to you, Lord; <sup>2</sup>Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy. <sup>3</sup>If you, Lord, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand? <sup>4</sup>But with you there is forgiveness, so that we can, with reverence, serve you. <sup>5</sup>I wait for the Lord, my whole being waits, and in his word I put my hope. <sup>6</sup>I wait for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning, more than watchmen wait for the morning. <sup>7</sup>Israel, put your hope in the Lord, for with the Lord is unfailing love and with him is full redemption. <sup>8</sup>He himself will redeem Israel from all their sins.",
