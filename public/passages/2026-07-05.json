  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Contend, Lord, with those who contend with me; fight against those who fight against me. <sup>2</sup>Take up shield and armor; arise and come to my aid. <sup>3</sup>Brandish spear and javelin against those who pursue me. Say to me, “I am your salvation.” <sup>4</sup>May those who seek my life be disgraced and put to shame; may those who plot my ruin be turned back in dismay. <sup>5</sup>May they be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the Lord driving them away; <sup>6</sup>may their path be dark and slippery, with the angel of the Lord pursuing them. <sup>7</sup>Since they hid their net for me without cause and without cause dug a pit for me, <sup>8</sup>may ruin overtake them by surprise— may the net they hid entangle them, may they fall into the pit, to their ruin. <sup>9</sup>Then my soul will rejoice in the Lord and delight in his salvation. <sup>10</sup>My whole being will exclaim, “Who is like you, Lord? You rescue the poor from those too strong for them, the poor and needy from those who rob them.” <sup>11</sup>Ruthless witnesses come forward; they question me on things I know nothing about. <sup>12</sup>They repay me evil for good and leave me like one bereaved. <sup>13</sup>Yet when they were ill, I put on sackcloth and humbled myself with fasting. When my prayers returned to me unanswered, <sup>14</sup>I went about mourning as though for my friend or brother. I bowed my head in grief as though weeping for my mother. <sup>15</sup>But when I stumbled, they gathered in glee; assailants gathered against me without my knowledge. They slandered me without ceasing. <sup>16</sup>Like the ungodly they maliciously mocked; they gnashed their teeth at me. <sup>17</sup>How long, Lord, will you look on? Rescue me from their ravages, my precious life from these lions. <sup>18</sup>I will give you thanks in the great assembly; among the throngs I will praise you. <sup>19</sup>Do not let those gloat over me who are my enemies without cause; do not let those who hate me without reason maliciously wink the eye. <sup>20</sup>They do not speak peaceably, but devise false accusations against those who live quietly in the land. <sup>21</sup>They sneer at me and say, “Aha! Aha! With our own eyes we have seen it.” <sup>22</sup>Lord, you have seen this; do not be silent. Do not be far from me, Lord. <sup>23</sup>Awake, and rise to my defense! Contend for me, my God and Lord. <sup>24</sup>Vindicate me in your righteousness, Lord my God; do not let them gloat over me. <sup>25</sup>Do not let them think, “Aha, just what we wanted!” or say, “We have swallowed him up.” <sup>26</sup>May all who gloat over my distress be put to shame and confusion; may all who exalt themselves over me be clothed with shame and disgrace. <sup>27</sup>May those who delight in my vindication shout for joy and gladness; may they always say, “The Lord be exalted, who delights in the well-being of his servant.” <sup>28</sup>My tongue will proclaim your righteousness, your praises all day long.",
