  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Lord, how many are my foes! How many rise up against me! <sup>2</sup>Many are saying of me, “God will not deliver him.” <sup>3</sup>But you, Lord, are a shield around me, my glory, the One who lifts my head high. <sup>4</sup>I call out to the Lord, and he answers me from his holy mountain. <sup>5</sup>I lie down and sleep; I wake again, because the Lord sustains me. <sup>6</sup>I will not fear though tens of thousands assail me on every side. <sup>7</sup>Arise, Lord! Deliver me, my God! Strike all my enemies on the jaw; break the teeth of the wicked. <sup>8</sup>From the Lord comes deliverance. May your blessing be on your people.",
