  "verses": "<sup>14</sup>When Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever. <sup>15</sup>He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on him. <sup>16</sup>When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick. <sup>17</sup>This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: “He took up our infirmities and bore our diseases.”",
