  "verses": "<sup>14</sup>Sing, Daughter Zion; shout aloud, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, Daughter Jerusalem! <sup>15</sup>The Lord has taken away your punishment, he has turned back your enemy. The Lord, the King of Israel, is with you; never again will you fear any harm. <sup>16</sup>On that day they will say to Jerusalem, “Do not fear, Zion; do not let your hands hang limp. <sup>17</sup>The Lord your God is with you, the Mighty Warrior who saves. He will take great delight in you; in his love he will no longer rebuke you, but will rejoice over you with singing.” <sup>18</sup>“I will remove from you all who mourn over the loss of your appointed festivals, which is a burden and reproach for you. <sup>19</sup>At that time I will deal with all who oppressed you. I will rescue the lame; I will gather the exiles. I will give them praise and honor in every land where they have suffered shame. <sup>20</sup>At that time I will gather you; at that time I will bring you home. I will give you honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth when I restore your fortunes before your very eyes,” says the Lord.",
