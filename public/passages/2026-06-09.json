  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>“When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son. <sup>2</sup>But the more they were called, the more they went away from me. They sacrificed to the Baals and they burned incense to images. <sup>3</sup>It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by the arms; but they did not realize it was I who healed them. <sup>4</sup>I led them with cords of human kindness, with ties of love. To them I was like one who lifts a little child to the cheek, and I bent down to feed them. <sup>5</sup>“Will they not return to Egypt and will not Assyria rule over them because they refuse to repent? <sup>6</sup>A sword will flash in their cities; it will devour their false prophets and put an end to their plans. <sup>7</sup>My people are determined to turn from me. Even though they call me God Most High, I will by no means exalt them. <sup>8</sup>“How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I treat you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboyim? My heart is changed within me; all my compassion is aroused. <sup>9</sup>I will not carry out my fierce anger, nor will I devastate Ephraim again. For I am God, and not a man— the Holy One among you. I will not come against their cities.",
