  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases, <sup>2</sup>and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. <sup>3</sup>He told them: “Take nothing for the journey—no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra shirt. <sup>4</sup>Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town. <sup>5</sup>If people do not welcome you, leave their town and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.” <sup>6</sup>So they set out and went from village to village, proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere.",
