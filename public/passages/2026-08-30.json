  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way that sinners take or sit in the company of mockers, <sup>2</sup>but whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law day and night. <sup>3</sup>That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither— whatever they do prospers. <sup>4</sup>Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away. <sup>5</sup>Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. <sup>6</sup>For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.",
