  "verses": "19-20When Jews from Jerusalem sent a group of priests and officials to ask John who he was, he was completely honest. He didn’t evade the question. He told the plain truth: “I am not the Messiah.” <sup>21</sup>They pressed him, “Who, then? Elijah?” “I am not.” “The Prophet?” “No.” <sup>22</sup>Exasperated, they said, “Who, then? We need an answer for those who sent us. Tell us something—anything!—about yourself.” <sup>23</sup>“I’m thunder in the desert: ‘Make the road straight for God!’ I’m doing what the prophet Isaiah preached.” 24-25Those sent to question him were from the Pharisee party. Now they had a question of their own: “If you’re neither the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet, why do you baptize?” 26-27John answered, “I only baptize using water. A person you don’t recognize has taken his stand in your midst. He comes after me, but he is not in second place to me. I’m not even worthy to hold his coat for him.” <sup>28</sup>These conversations took place in Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing at the time.",
