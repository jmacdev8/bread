  "verses": "1-2Bravo, God, bravo! Gods and all angels shout, “Encore!” In awe before the glory, in awe before God’s visible power. Stand at attention! Dress your best to honor him! <sup>3</sup>God thunders across the waters, Brilliant, his voice and his face, streaming brightness— God, across the flood waters. <sup>4</sup>God’s thunder tympanic, God’s thunder symphonic. <sup>5</sup>God’s thunder smashes cedars, God topples the northern cedars. <sup>6</sup>The mountain ranges skip like spring colts, The high ridges jump like wild kid goats. 7-8God’s thunder spits fire. God thunders, the wilderness quakes; He makes the desert of Kadesh shake. <sup>9</sup>God’s thunder sets the oak trees dancing A wild dance, whirling; the pelting rain strips their branches. We fall to our knees—we call out, “Glory!” <sup>10</sup>Above the floodwaters is God’s throne from which his power flows, from which he rules the world. <sup>11</sup>God makes his people strong. God gives his people peace.",
