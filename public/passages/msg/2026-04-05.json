  "verses": "1-3God, my shepherd! I don’t need a thing. You have bedded me down in lush meadows, you find me quiet pools to drink from. True to your word, you let me catch my breath and send me in the right direction. <sup>4</sup>Even when the way goes through Death Valley, I’m not afraid when you walk at my side. Your trusty shepherd’s crook makes me feel secure. <sup>5</sup>You serve me a six-course dinner right in front of my enemies. You revive my drooping head; my cup brims with blessing. <sup>6</sup>Your beauty and love chase after me every day of my life. I’m back home in the house of God for the rest of my life.",
