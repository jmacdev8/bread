  "verses": "1-2a Sing God a brand-new song! Earth and everyone in it, sing! Sing to God—worship God! 2b-3 Shout the news of his victory from sea to sea, Take the news of his glory to the lost, News of his wonders to one and all! 4-5a For God is great, and worth a thousand Hallelujahs. His furious beauty puts the other gods to shame; Pagan gods are mere tatters and rags. 5b-6 God made the heavens— Royal splendor radiates from him, A powerful beauty sets him apart. <sup>7</sup>Bravo, God, Bravo! Everyone join in the great shout: Encore! In awe before the beauty, in awe before the might. 8-9Bring gifts and celebrate, Bow before the beauty of God, Then to your knees—everyone worship! <sup>10</sup>Get out the message—God Rules! He put the world on a firm foundation; He treats everyone fair and square. <sup>11</sup>Let’s hear it from Sky, With Earth joining in, And a huge round of applause from Sea. <sup>12</sup>Let Wilderness turn cartwheels, Animals, come dance, Put every tree of the forest in the choir— <sup>13</sup>An extravaganza before God as he comes, As he comes to set everything right on earth, Set everything right, treat everyone fair.",
