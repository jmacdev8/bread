  "verses": "1-2I look up to the mountains; does my strength come from mountains? No, my strength comes from God, who made heaven, and earth, and mountains. 3-4He won’t let you stumble, your Guardian God won’t fall asleep. Not on your life! Israel’s Guardian will never doze or sleep. 5-6God’s your Guardian, right at your side to protect you— Shielding you from sunstroke, sheltering you from moonstroke. 7-8God guards you from every evil, he guards your very life. He guards you when you leave and when you return, he guards you now, he guards you always.",
