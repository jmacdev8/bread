  "verses": "<sup>28</sup>After saying this, she went to her sister Mary and whispered in her ear, “The Teacher is here and is asking for you.” 29-32The moment she heard that, she jumped up and ran out to him. Jesus had not yet entered the town but was still at the place where Martha had met him. When her sympathizing Jewish friends saw Mary run off, they followed her, thinking she was on her way to the tomb to weep there. Mary came to where Jesus was waiting and fell at his feet, saying, “Master, if only you had been here, my brother would not have died.” 33-34a When Jesus saw her sobbing and the Jews with her sobbing, a deep anger welled up within him. He said, “Where did you put him?” 34b-35 “Master, come and see,” they said. Now Jesus wept. <sup>36</sup>The Jews said, “Look how deeply he loved him.” <sup>37</sup>Others among them said, “Well, if he loved him so much, why didn’t he do something to keep him from dying? After all, he opened the eyes of a blind man.”",
