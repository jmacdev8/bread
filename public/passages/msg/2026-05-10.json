  "verses": "1-2All you who fear God, how blessed you are! how happily you walk on his smooth straight road! You worked hard and deserve all you’ve got coming. Enjoy the blessing! Soak in the goodness! 3-4Your wife will bear children as a vine bears grapes, your household lush as a vineyard, The children around your table as fresh and promising as young olive shoots. Stand in awe of God’s Yes. Oh, how he blesses the one who fears God! 5-6Enjoy the good life in Jerusalem every day of your life. And enjoy your grandchildren. Peace to Israel!",
