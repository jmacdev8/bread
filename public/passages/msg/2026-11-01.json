  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>When I call, give me answers. God, take my side! Once, in a tight place, you gave me room; Now I’m in trouble again: grace me! hear me! <sup>2</sup>You rabble—how long do I put up with your scorn? How long will you lust after lies? How long will you live crazed by illusion? <sup>3</sup>Look at this: look Who got picked by God! He listens the split second I call to him. 4-5Complain if you must, but don’t lash out. Keep your mouth shut, and let your heart do the talking. Build your case before God and wait for his verdict. 6-7a Why is everyone hungry for more? “More, more,” they say. “More, more.” I have God’s more-than-enough, More joy in one ordinary day 7b-8 Than they get in all their shopping sprees. At day’s end I’m ready for sound sleep, For you, God, have put my life back together.",
