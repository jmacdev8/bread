  "verses": "<sup>57</sup>On the road someone asked if he could go along. “I’ll go with you, wherever,” he said. <sup>58</sup>Jesus was curt: “Are you ready to rough it? We’re not staying in the best inns, you know.” Jesus said to another, “Follow me.” <sup>59</sup>He said, “Certainly, but first excuse me for a couple of days, please. I have to make arrangements for my father’s funeral.” <sup>60</sup>Jesus refused. “First things first. Your business is life, not death. And life is urgent: Announce God’s kingdom!” <sup>61</sup>Then another said, “I’m ready to follow you, Master, but first excuse me while I get things straightened out at home.” <sup>62</sup>Jesus said, “No procrastination. No backward looks. You can’t put God’s kingdom off till tomorrow. Seize the day.”",
