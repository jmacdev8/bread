  "verses": "1-2God! Look! Enemies past counting! Enemies sprouting like mushrooms, Mobs of them all around me, roaring their mockery: “Hah! No help for him from God!” 3-4But you, God, shield me on all sides; You ground my feet, you lift my head high; With all my might I shout up to God, His answers thunder from the holy mountain. 5-6I stretch myself out. I sleep. Then I’m up again—rested, tall and steady, Fearless before the enemy mobs Coming at me from all sides. <sup>7</sup>Up, God! My God, help me! Slap their faces, First this cheek, then the other, Your fist hard in their teeth! <sup>8</sup>Real help comes from God. Your blessing clothes your people!",
