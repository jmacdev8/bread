  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>How well God must like you— you don’t walk in the ruts of those blind-as-bats, you don’t stand with the good-for-nothings, you don’t take your seat among the know-it-alls. 2-3Instead you thrill to God’s Word, you chew on Scripture day and night. You’re a tree replanted in Eden, bearing fresh fruit every month, Never dropping a leaf, always in blossom. 4-5You’re not at all like the wicked, who are mere windblown dust— Without defense in court, unfit company for innocent people. <sup>6</sup>God charts the road you take. The road they take leads to nowhere.",
