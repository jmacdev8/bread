  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Don’t turn a deaf ear when I call you, God. If all I get from you is deafening silence, I’d be better off in the Black Hole. <sup>2</sup>I’m letting you know what I need, calling out for help And lifting my arms toward your inner sanctuary. 3-4Don’t shove me into the same jail cell with those crooks, With those who are full-time employees of evil. They talk a good line of “peace,” then moonlight for the Devil. Pay them back for what they’ve done, for how bad they’ve been. Pay them back for their long hours in the Devil’s workshop; Then cap it with a huge bonus. <sup>5</sup>Because they have no idea how God works or what he is up to, God will smash them to smithereens and walk away from the ruins. 6-7Blessed be God— he heard me praying. He proved he’s on my side; I’ve thrown my lot in with him. Now I’m jumping for joy, and shouting and singing my thanks to him. 8-9God is all strength for his people, ample refuge for his chosen leader; Save your people and bless your heritage. Care for them; carry them like a good shepherd.",
