  "verses": "17-20When Jesus finally got there, he found Lazarus already four days dead. Bethany was near Jerusalem, only a couple of miles away, and many of the Jews were visiting Martha and Mary, sympathizing with them over their brother. Martha heard Jesus was coming and went out to meet him. Mary remained in the house. 21-22Martha said, “Master, if you’d been here, my brother wouldn’t have died. Even now, I know that whatever you ask God he will give you.” <sup>23</sup>Jesus said, “Your brother will be raised up.” <sup>24</sup>Martha replied, “I know that he will be raised up in the resurrection at the end of time.” 25-26“You don’t have to wait for the End. I am, right now, Resurrection and Life. The one who believes in me, even though he or she dies, will live. And everyone who lives believing in me does not ultimately die at all. Do you believe this?” <sup>27</sup>“Yes, Master. All along I have believed that you are the Messiah, the Son of God who comes into the world.”",
