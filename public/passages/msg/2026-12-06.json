  "verses": "1-2God, the one and only— I’ll wait as long as he says. Everything I need comes from him, so why not? He’s solid rock under my feet, breathing room for my soul, An impregnable castle: I’m set for life. 3-4How long will you gang up on me? How long will you run with the bullies? There’s nothing to you, any of you— rotten floorboards, worm-eaten rafters, Anthills plotting to bring down mountains, far gone in make-believe. You talk a good line, but every “blessing” breathes a curse. 5-6God, the one and only— I’ll wait as long as he says. Everything I hope for comes from him, so why not? He’s solid rock under my feet, breathing room for my soul, An impregnable castle: I’m set for life. 7-8My help and glory are in God —granite-strength and safe-harbor-God— So trust him absolutely, people; lay your lives on the line for him. God is a safe place to be. <sup>9</sup>Man as such is smoke, woman as such, a mirage. Put them together, they’re nothing; two times nothing is nothing. <sup>10</sup>And a windfall, if it comes— don’t make too much of it. <sup>11</sup>God said this once and for all; how many times Have I heard it repeated? “Strength comes Straight from God.” <sup>12</sup>Love to you, Lord God! You pay a fair wage for a good day’s work!",
