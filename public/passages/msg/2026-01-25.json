  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>God, I’m not trying to rule the roost, I don’t want to be king of the mountain. I haven’t meddled where I have no business or fantasized grandiose plans. <sup>2</sup>I’ve kept my feet on the ground, I’ve cultivated a quiet heart. Like a baby content in its mother’s arms, my soul is a baby content. <sup>3</sup>Wait, Israel, for God. Wait with hope. Hope now; hope always!",
