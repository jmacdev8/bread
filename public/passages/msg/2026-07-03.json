  "verses": "<sup>16</sup>The people answered, “We’d never forsake God! Never! We’d never leave God to worship other gods. 17-18“God is our God! He brought up our ancestors from Egypt and from slave conditions. He did all those great signs while we watched. He has kept his eye on us all along the roads we’ve traveled and among the nations we’ve passed through. Just for us he drove out all the nations, Amorites and all, who lived in the land. “Count us in: We too are going to worship God. He’s our God.” 19-20Then Joshua told the people: “You can’t do it; you’re not able to worship God. He is a holy God. He is a jealous God. He won’t put up with your fooling around and sinning. When you leave God and take up the worship of foreign gods, he’ll turn right around and come down on you hard. He’ll put an end to you—and after all the good he has done for you!” <sup>21</sup>But the people told Joshua: “No! No! We worship God!” <sup>22</sup>And so Joshua addressed the people: “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen God for yourselves—to worship him.” And they said, “We are witnesses.” <sup>23</sup>Joshua said, “Now get rid of all the foreign gods you have with you. Say an unqualified Yes to God, the God of Israel.” <sup>24</sup>The people answered Joshua, “We will worship God. What he says, we’ll do.” 25-26Joshua completed a Covenant for the people that day there at Shechem. He made it official, spelling it out in detail. Joshua wrote out all the directions and regulations into the Book of The Revelation of God. Then he took a large stone and set it up under the oak that was in the holy place of God. <sup>27</sup>Joshua spoke to all the people: “This stone is a witness against us. It has heard every word that God has said to us. It is a standing witness against you lest you cheat on your God.” <sup>28</sup>Then Joshua dismissed the people, each to his own place of inheritance. * * *",
