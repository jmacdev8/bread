  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>I lift you high in praise, my God, O my King! and I’ll bless your name into eternity. <sup>2</sup>I’ll bless you every day, and keep it up from now to eternity. <sup>3</sup>God is magnificent; he can never be praised enough. There are no boundaries to his greatness. <sup>4</sup>Generation after generation stands in awe of your work; each one tells stories of your mighty acts. <sup>5</sup>Your beauty and splendor have everyone talking; I compose songs on your wonders. <sup>6</sup>Your marvelous doings are headline news; I could write a book full of the details of your greatness. <sup>7</sup>The fame of your goodness spreads across the country; your righteousness is on everyone’s lips. <sup>8</sup>God is all mercy and grace— not quick to anger, is rich in love. <sup>9</sup>God is good to one and all; everything he does is soaked through with grace. 10-11Creation and creatures applaud you, God; your holy people bless you. They talk about the glories of your rule, they exclaim over your splendor, <sup>12</sup>Letting the world know of your power for good, the lavish splendor of your kingdom. <sup>13</sup>Your kingdom is a kingdom eternal; you never get voted out of office. God always does what he says, and is gracious in everything he does. <sup>14</sup>God gives a hand to those down on their luck, gives a fresh start to those ready to quit. <sup>15</sup>All eyes are on you, expectant; you give them their meals on time. <sup>16</sup>Generous to a fault, you lavish your favor on all creatures. <sup>17</sup>Everything God does is right— the trademark on all his works is love. <sup>18</sup>God’s there, listening for all who pray, for all who pray and mean it. <sup>19</sup>He does what’s best for those who fear him— hears them call out, and saves them. <sup>20</sup>God sticks by all who love him, but it’s all over for those who don’t. <sup>21</sup>My mouth is filled with God’s praise. Let everything living bless him, bless his holy name from now to eternity!",
