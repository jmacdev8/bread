  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Count yourself lucky, how happy you must be— you get a fresh start, your slate’s wiped clean. <sup>2</sup>Count yourself lucky— God holds nothing against you and you’re holding nothing back from him. <sup>3</sup>When I kept it all inside, my bones turned to powder, my words became daylong groans. <sup>4</sup>The pressure never let up; all the juices of my life dried up. <sup>5</sup>Then I let it all out; I said, “I’ll come clean about my failures to God.” Suddenly the pressure was gone— my guilt dissolved, my sin disappeared. <sup>6</sup>These things add up. Every one of us needs to pray; when all hell breaks loose and the dam bursts we’ll be on high ground, untouched. <sup>7</sup>God’s my island hideaway, keeps danger far from the shore, throws garlands of hosannas around my neck. <sup>8</sup>Let me give you some good advice; I’m looking you in the eye and giving it to you straight: <sup>9</sup>“Don’t be ornery like a horse or mule that needs bit and bridle to stay on track.” <sup>10</sup>God-defiers are always in trouble; God-affirmers find themselves loved every time they turn around. <sup>11</sup>Celebrate God. Sing together—everyone! All you honest hearts, raise the roof!",
