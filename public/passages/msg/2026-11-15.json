  "verses": "1-2Keep me safe, O God, I’ve run for dear life to you. I say to God, “Be my Lord!” Without you, nothing makes sense. <sup>3</sup>And these God-chosen lives all around— what splendid friends they make! <sup>4</sup>Don’t just go shopping for a god. Gods are not for sale. I swear I’ll never treat god-names like brand-names. 5-6My choice is you, God, first and only. And now I find I’m your choice! You set me up with a house and yard. And then you made me your heir! 7-8The wise counsel God gives when I’m awake is confirmed by my sleeping heart. Day and night I’ll stick with God; I’ve got a good thing going and I’m not letting go. 9-10I’m happy from the inside out, and from the outside in, I’m firmly formed. You canceled my ticket to hell— that’s not my destination! <sup>11</sup>Now you’ve got my feet on the life path, all radiant from the shining of your face. Ever since you took my hand, I’m on the right way.",
