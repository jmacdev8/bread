  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>You, God, are my God, earnestly I seek you; I thirst for you, my whole being longs for you, in a dry and parched land where there is no water. <sup>2</sup>I have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and your glory. <sup>3</sup>Because your love is better than life, my lips will glorify you. <sup>4</sup>I will praise you as long as I live, and in your name I will lift up my hands. <sup>5</sup>I will be fully satisfied as with the richest of foods; with singing lips my mouth will praise you. <sup>6</sup>On my bed I remember you; I think of you through the watches of the night. <sup>7</sup>Because you are my help, I sing in the shadow of your wings. <sup>8</sup>I cling to you; your right hand upholds me. <sup>9</sup>Those who want to kill me will be destroyed; they will go down to the depths of the earth. <sup>10</sup>They will be given over to the sword and become food for jackals. <sup>11</sup>But the king will rejoice in God; all who swear by God will glory in him, while the mouths of liars will be silenced.",
