  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. <sup>2</sup>And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others. <sup>3</sup>Join with me in suffering, like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. <sup>4</sup>No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in civilian affairs, but rather tries to please his commanding officer. <sup>5</sup>Similarly, anyone who competes as an athlete does not receive the victor’s crown except by competing according to the rules. <sup>6</sup>The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops. <sup>7</sup>Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this. <sup>8</sup>Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my gospel, <sup>9</sup>for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God’s word is not chained. <sup>10</sup>Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory. <sup>11</sup>Here is a trustworthy saying: If we died with him, we will also live with him; <sup>12</sup>if we endure, we will also reign with him. If we disown him, he will also disown us; <sup>13</sup>if we are faithless, he remains faithful, for he cannot disown himself.",
