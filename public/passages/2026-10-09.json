  "verses": "<sup>35</sup>“Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning, <sup>36</sup>like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him. <sup>37</sup>It will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes. Truly I tell you, he will dress himself to serve, will have them recline at the table and will come and wait on them. <sup>38</sup>It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready, even if he comes in the middle of the night or toward daybreak. <sup>39</sup>But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into. <sup>40</sup>You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.”",
