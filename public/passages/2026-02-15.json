  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Shout for joy to God, all the earth! <sup>2</sup>Sing the glory of his name; make his praise glorious. <sup>3</sup>Say to God, “How awesome are your deeds! So great is your power that your enemies cringe before you. <sup>4</sup>All the earth bows down to you; they sing praise to you, they sing the praises of your name.” <sup>5</sup>Come and see what God has done, his awesome deeds for mankind! <sup>6</sup>He turned the sea into dry land, they passed through the waters on foot— come, let us rejoice in him. <sup>7</sup>He rules forever by his power, his eyes watch the nations— let not the rebellious rise up against him. <sup>8</sup>Praise our God, all peoples, let the sound of his praise be heard; <sup>9</sup>he has preserved our lives and kept our feet from slipping. <sup>10</sup>For you, God, tested us; you refined us like silver. <sup>11</sup>You brought us into prison and laid burdens on our backs. <sup>12</sup>You let people ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, but you brought us to a place of abundance. <sup>13</sup>I will come to your temple with burnt offerings and fulfill my vows to you— <sup>14</sup>vows my lips promised and my mouth spoke when I was in trouble. <sup>15</sup>I will sacrifice fat animals to you and an offering of rams; I will offer bulls and goats. <sup>16</sup>Come and hear, all you who fear God; let me tell you what he has done for me. <sup>17</sup>I cried out to him with my mouth; his praise was on my tongue. <sup>18</sup>If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened; <sup>19</sup>but God has surely listened and has heard my prayer. <sup>20</sup>Praise be to God, who has not rejected my prayer or withheld his love from me!",
