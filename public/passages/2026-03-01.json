  "verses": "<sup>33</sup>Teach me, Lord, the way of your decrees, that I may follow it to the end. <sup>34</sup>Give me understanding, so that I may keep your law and obey it with all my heart. <sup>35</sup>Direct me in the path of your commands, for there I find delight. <sup>36</sup>Turn my heart toward your statutes and not toward selfish gain. <sup>37</sup>Turn my eyes away from worthless things; preserve my life according to your word. <sup>38</sup>Fulfill your promise to your servant, so that you may be feared. <sup>39</sup>Take away the disgrace I dread, for your laws are good. <sup>40</sup>How I long for your precepts! In your righteousness preserve my life. ו Waw <sup>41</sup>May your unfailing love come to me, Lord, your salvation, according to your promise; <sup>42</sup>then I can answer anyone who taunts me, for I trust in your word. <sup>43</sup>Never take your word of truth from my mouth, for I have put my hope in your laws. <sup>44</sup>I will always obey your law, for ever and ever. <sup>45</sup>I will walk about in freedom, for I have sought out your precepts. <sup>46</sup>I will speak of your statutes before kings and will not be put to shame, <sup>47</sup>for I delight in your commands because I love them. <sup>48</sup>I reach out for your commands, which I love, that I may meditate on your decrees. ז Zayin",
