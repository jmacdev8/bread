  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>I have a message from God in my heart concerning the sinfulness of the wicked: There is no fear of God before their eyes. <sup>2</sup>In their own eyes they flatter themselves too much to detect or hate their sin. <sup>3</sup>The words of their mouths are wicked and deceitful; they fail to act wisely or do good. <sup>4</sup>Even on their beds they plot evil; they commit themselves to a sinful course and do not reject what is wrong. <sup>5</sup>Your love, Lord, reaches to the heavens, your faithfulness to the skies. <sup>6</sup>Your righteousness is like the highest mountains, your justice like the great deep. You, Lord, preserve both people and animals. <sup>7</sup>How priceless is your unfailing love, O God! People take refuge in the shadow of your wings. <sup>8</sup>They feast on the abundance of your house; you give them drink from your river of delights. <sup>9</sup>For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light. <sup>10</sup>Continue your love to those who know you, your righteousness to the upright in heart. <sup>11</sup>May the foot of the proud not come against me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away. <sup>12</sup>See how the evildoers lie fallen— thrown down, not able to rise!",
