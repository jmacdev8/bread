  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. <sup>2</sup>Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, <sup>3</sup>though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging. <sup>4</sup>There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells. <sup>5</sup>God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day. <sup>6</sup>Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall; he lifts his voice, the earth melts. <sup>7</sup>The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. <sup>8</sup>Come and see what the Lord has done, the desolations he has brought on the earth. <sup>9</sup>He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth. He breaks the bow and shatters the spear; he burns the shields with fire. <sup>10</sup>He says, “Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.” <sup>11</sup>The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.",
