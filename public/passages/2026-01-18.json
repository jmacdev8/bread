  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord from the heavens; praise him in the heights above. <sup>2</sup>Praise him, all his angels; praise him, all his heavenly hosts. <sup>3</sup>Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all you shining stars. <sup>4</sup>Praise him, you highest heavens and you waters above the skies. <sup>5</sup>Let them praise the name of the Lord, for at his command they were created, <sup>6</sup>and he established them for ever and ever— he issued a decree that will never pass away. <sup>7</sup>Praise the Lord from the earth, you great sea creatures and all ocean depths, <sup>8</sup>lightning and hail, snow and clouds, stormy winds that do his bidding, <sup>9</sup>you mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars, <sup>10</sup>wild animals and all cattle, small creatures and flying birds, <sup>11</sup>kings of the earth and all nations, you princes and all rulers on earth, <sup>12</sup>young men and women, old men and children. <sup>13</sup>Let them praise the name of the Lord, for his name alone is exalted; his splendor is above the earth and the heavens. <sup>14</sup>And he has raised up for his people a horn, the praise of all his faithful servants, of Israel, the people close to his heart. Praise the Lord.",
