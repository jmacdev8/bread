  "verses": "<sup>36</sup>While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.” <sup>37</sup>They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. <sup>38</sup>He said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? <sup>39</sup>Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.” <sup>40</sup>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. <sup>41</sup>And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?” <sup>42</sup>They gave him a piece of broiled fish, <sup>43</sup>and he took it and ate it in their presence. <sup>44</sup>He said to them, “This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.” <sup>45</sup>Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. <sup>46</sup>He told them, “This is what is written: The Messiah will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, <sup>47</sup>and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. <sup>48</sup>You are witnesses of these things. <sup>49</sup>I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.” <sup>50</sup>When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them. <sup>51</sup>While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven. <sup>52</sup>Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. <sup>53</sup>And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God.",
