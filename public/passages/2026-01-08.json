  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go. <sup>2</sup>He told them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field. <sup>3</sup>Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves. <sup>4</sup>Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do not greet anyone on the road. <sup>5</sup>“When you enter a house, first say, ‘Peace to this house.’ <sup>6</sup>If someone who promotes peace is there, your peace will rest on them; if not, it will return to you. <sup>7</sup>Stay there, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house. <sup>8</sup>“When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is offered to you. <sup>9</sup>Heal the sick who are there and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near to you.’ <sup>10</sup>But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say, <sup>11</sup>‘Even the dust of your town we wipe from our feet as a warning to you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God has come near.’ <sup>12</sup>I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town.",
