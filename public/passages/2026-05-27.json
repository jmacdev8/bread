  "verses": "<sup>21</sup>“I will display my glory among the nations, and all the nations will see the punishment I inflict and the hand I lay on them. <sup>22</sup>From that day forward the people of Israel will know that I am the Lord their God. <sup>23</sup>And the nations will know that the people of Israel went into exile for their sin, because they were unfaithful to me. So I hid my face from them and handed them over to their enemies, and they all fell by the sword. <sup>24</sup>I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and their offenses, and I hid my face from them. <sup>25</sup>“Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will now restore the fortunes of Jacob and will have compassion on all the people of Israel, and I will be zealous for my holy name. <sup>26</sup>They will forget their shame and all the unfaithfulness they showed toward me when they lived in safety in their land with no one to make them afraid. <sup>27</sup>When I have brought them back from the nations and have gathered them from the countries of their enemies, I will be proved holy through them in the sight of many nations. <sup>28</sup>Then they will know that I am the Lord their God, for though I sent them into exile among the nations, I will gather them to their own land, not leaving any behind. <sup>29</sup>I will no longer hide my face from them, for I will pour out my Spirit on the people of Israel, declares the Sovereign Lord.”",
