  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>My heart is stirred by a noble theme as I recite my verses for the king; my tongue is the pen of a skillful writer. <sup>2</sup>You are the most excellent of men and your lips have been anointed with grace, since God has blessed you forever. <sup>3</sup>Gird your sword on your side, you mighty one; clothe yourself with splendor and majesty. <sup>4</sup>In your majesty ride forth victoriously in the cause of truth, humility and justice; let your right hand achieve awesome deeds. <sup>5</sup>Let your sharp arrows pierce the hearts of the king’s enemies; let the nations fall beneath your feet. <sup>6</sup>Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom. <sup>7</sup>You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy. <sup>8</sup>All your robes are fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia; from palaces adorned with ivory the music of the strings makes you glad. <sup>9</sup>Daughters of kings are among your honored women; at your right hand is the royal bride in gold of Ophir. <sup>10</sup>Listen, daughter, and pay careful attention: Forget your people and your father’s house. <sup>11</sup>Let the king be enthralled by your beauty; honor him, for he is your lord. <sup>12</sup>The city of Tyre will come with a gift, people of wealth will seek your favor. <sup>13</sup>All glorious is the princess within her chamber; her gown is interwoven with gold. <sup>14</sup>In embroidered garments she is led to the king; her virgin companions follow her— those brought to be with her. <sup>15</sup>Led in with joy and gladness, they enter the palace of the king. <sup>16</sup>Your sons will take the place of your fathers; you will make them princes throughout the land. <sup>17</sup>I will perpetuate your memory through all generations; therefore the nations will praise you for ever and ever.",
