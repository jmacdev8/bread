  "verses": "<sup>10</sup>By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should build with care. <sup>11</sup>For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ. <sup>12</sup>If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw, <sup>13</sup>their work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each person’s work. <sup>14</sup>If what has been built survives, the builder will receive a reward. <sup>15</sup>If it is burned up, the builder will suffer loss but yet will be saved—even though only as one escaping through the flames. <sup>16</sup>Don’t you know that you yourselves are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in your midst? <sup>17</sup>If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy that person; for God’s temple is sacred, and you together are that temple.",
