  "verses": "<sup>1</sup>It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery. <sup>2</sup>Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all. <sup>3</sup>Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law. <sup>4</sup>You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace. <sup>5</sup>For through the Spirit we eagerly await by faith the righteousness for which we hope. <sup>6</sup>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love. <sup>7</sup>You were running a good race. Who cut in on you to keep you from obeying the truth? <sup>8</sup>That kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you. <sup>9</sup>“A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough.” <sup>10</sup>I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is throwing you into confusion, whoever that may be, will have to pay the penalty. <sup>11</sup>Brothers and sisters, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished. <sup>12</sup>As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves! <sup>13</sup>You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love. <sup>14</sup>For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” <sup>15</sup>If you bite and devour each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other.",
